From the glittering headquarters of global tech giants to the darkest corners of online chatrooms, the Internet Watch Foundation takes you down the rabbit hole, lifting the lid on the global scandal of countless child sexual abuse images and videos being shared on the open web every day. The investigation begins here. Join us as we meet the victims, the police, the charities, the experts, and even the criminals at the frontline of this global battle raging behind the screen. The battle to keep children safe and protect them from the very worst abuse at the hands of some of the most depraved criminals. Each week, Pixels from a Crime Scene delves deeper into this clandestine world, shining a spotlight on what really goes on online and why images and videos showing the sexual abuse of children are still spreading across the open web.</description>

    <description>as much as its important to quarantine, self-isolate &amp; social distance; we still need to keep in mind what could happen if we start involving the military &amp; government in enforcing our lives in the near future. would it end up like George Orwell's 1984?</description>

    <description>In Someone Knows Something Season 6, Debra has been searching for her son, Donald Izzett Jr. for 25 years. The last time she spoke with him was Mother&#x2019;s Day. He had called from a road trip, but sounded upset, saying he needed money. Then the phone went dead. Donnie&#x2019;s friend told police that he dropped him off in New Orleans. But Debra thinks he was murdered. And decides to investigate the case herself. Here's an excerpt from the first episode. Full episodes are available at hyperurl.co/skscbc</description>

    <description>The 1950s &amp; 60s saw a wave of radical movements. Che Guevara and the Cuban Revolution. The Black Panthers. Quebec and Canada had the FLQ &#x2014; a showdown that dissolved into crisis. By October 1970, there were soldiers in the streets, communities on edge, kidnapping and terror in the headlines. But those frightening weeks were just the crescendo of a wave of terror and violence that was nearly a decade in the making. This series will reveal the stories of that time through immersive storytelling and the people who lived it: the bomb disposal expert on defusing live explosives, the survivors of terror, their families, and the radicals themselves. More episodes are available at http://hyperurl.co/recallcbc</description>

    <description>Brainwashed investigates the CIA&#x2019;s covert mind control experiments &#x2013; from the Cold War and MKULTRA to the so-called War on Terror. It&#x2019;s the story of how a renowned psychiatrist used his unwitting patients as human guinea pigs at a Montreal hospital, and the ripple effects on survivors, their families, and thousands of other people around the world. It also examines the cultural impact &#x2014; how the CIA brought LSD to America and inadvertently created counterculture influencers such as author Ken Kessey and poet Allen Ginsberg. It&#x2019;s an exploration of what happens in times of fear, when the military and medicine collide. And what happens when the survivors fight back.

    <description>The Prime Minister, Theresa May, answered questions from MPs in the House of Commons on Wednesday 24 October 2018. https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2018/october/prime-ministers-questions-17-october-2018/ Question Time in the House of Commons is an opportunity for MPs to question government ministers about matters for which they are responsible. Prime Minister's Question Time, also referred to as PMQs, takes place every Wednesday that the House of Commons is sitting and gives MPs the chance to put questions to the Prime Minister. In most cases, the session starts with a routine 'open question' from an MP about the Prime Minister's engagements. MPs can then ask supplementary questions on any subject, often one of current political significance. The Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn asks six questions and the leader of the second largest opposition party - currently the Scottish National Party - asks two.

    <description>This week on Science Today. A new role of the brain&#x2019;s hippocampus has been discovered. Cognitive neuroscientist Robert Knight of the University of California, Berkeley explains this is the part of the brain where Alzheimer&#x2019;s often starts. But until now, the hippocampus was only known for storing memories. But as Knight found, it&#x2019;s also involved in generating language. "It is not just being told what to do by the cortex and the language areas. They are both contributing to effective language capacities. It kind of elevates the hippocampus out of the memory field and puts it to a more global cognitive domain &#x2013; in this case, language." It just goes to show that researchers still have a lot to learn &#x2013; and as we found out in our next story, one thing that&#x2019;s been helpful are study cohorts. Epidemiologist Janet Wojcicki of the University of California, San Francisco says she&#x2019;s been able to garner so much information beyond her original research following a Latina cohort recruited in pregnancy and followed a number of years. "Our primary outcome was really to better understand factors that are related to obesity and development of chronic disease in early childhood, but we also measured telomeres, the protective cap of the DNA." Shorter telomeres are associated with chronic disease development and Wojcicki found that in this cohort, early, exclusive breastfeeding of infants was linked to longer telomeres. And next, we visit the beautiful Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego to talk to atmospheric scientist V. &#x2018;Ram&#x2019; Ramanathan. He&#x2019;s written countless studies, which he called &#x201C;obituaries of the planet&#x2019; after successfully predicting a significant increase in global warming within the next two decades. And yet, he felt no one was listening. So, as a member of the Vatican&#x2019;s Pontifical Academy of Sciences, he took his message to the Pope. "So I told him basically to talk about climate change in his speeches and urge people to be better stewards of the planet. Ten days later, he made this major pronouncement and talked about climate change and warned people if you destroy nature, it will destroy you." This later became known in climate change communication circles as &#x2018;The Francis Effect&#x2019;, but that&#x2019;s a story for another time.

    <description>This week on Science Today. Your brain is a precious organ, and one way your body protects it is by using the blood-brain barrier. This is basically a filter set up between the blood in your circulatory system and your brain. The barrier determines which things will or will not pass through. At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, bioengineer Monica Moya is hoping their 3D bioprinting technology can help recreate the structure. "So we&#x2019;re trying to build the blood-brain barrier, which is the blood vessels in your brain that are responsible for making sure that not just anything gets across, but that&#x2019;s an interesting field because sometimes you do want things to get across." A 3D printed blood-brain barrier would be helpful for something like drug research, because you actually want certain medications to pass through. We also speak with UC Berkeley chemist Chris Chang about another surprising feature of the brain &#x2013; the metal nutrient copper. Chang explains how copper helps your body metabolize fat. "There&#x2019;s a process which stops normal fat burning, and what we found was that copper stops or blocks what normally blocks fat burning. And so by blocking the block, then you actually allow fat burning to proceed." And did you know that NSAIDs, a common type of anti-inflammatory, can be bad for your heart? Researcher Aldrin Gomes of the University of California, Davis found that vitamin C might prevent this toxicity. "We pretreated the cells with vitamin C before we gave NSAIDs, and this prevented cell death." If you want to keep on top of the latest University of California research.

    <description>How do you test a new theory on how cephalopods see color? Creatures like octopuses only have one type of light receptor in their eyes, meaning they have black and white vision. But graduate student Alexander Stubbs of the University of California, Berkeley teamed up with his father, Harvard astrophysicist Christopher Stubbs, to design a computer model simulating how cephalopods might be able to use their strangely shaped pupils to detect color. "There&#x2019;ve been a number of studies studying the physical optical properties of cephalopod eyes, and then a really rich history of behavioral experiments on cephalopods. So we used the measured optical properties of cephalopod eyes, and then we were able to complete our computer simulation to be able to look at the refractive properties of cephalopod eyes with real spectra that they might encounter in their natural habitat. And I&#x2019;d say we sort of show, as a proof of concept, that this could work for those organisms and that it&#x2019;s consistent with prior behavioral data." It turns out that contrast was particularly important for picking out colors. </description>

    <description>An older generation antibiotic that&#x2019;s currently used in animals to reduce bacterial infections was found to block contemporary strains of Zika virus in human tissue in the lab. We met up with Dr. Lenore Pereira of UC San Francisco, who joined forces with colleagues at UC Berkeley to make this discovery. "What&#x2019;s interesting about this drug, it&#x2019;s called Duramycin, it&#x2019;s a small molecule inhibitor and it works directly against the virus envelope &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t work against the cell, so it&#x2019;s very specific for Zika virus, Dengue, Ebola. We are thrilled about the finding." And over at the Livermore Lab, computer scientists are excited their software-based network security tool is overcoming some of the limitations of commercial-based products. It&#x2019;s called Network Mapping System, or NeMS and as Domingo Colon explains, it gives administrators and security personnel a better way to constantly assess what a user&#x2019;s environment looks like. "It provides them a pretty immediate feedback to figure out who&#x2019;s doing what and is this a problem? Sometimes you need that immediacy and to determine from that information is it something that you need to take action on?" Meanwhile, materials scientists at UC Riverside describe how their work with nanocrystalline metals can be used beyond automotive and transportation applications. "Including things like biomedical implants. If we can make things like stents and facial implants out of lightweight materials like magnesium, the magnesium will also dissolve in the body over time and the implant may not have to be removed."

    <description>Saturated fats do more than just make a person pack on calories. Endocrinologist Suneil Koliwad of the University of California, San Francisco found that saturated fats essentially short-circuit immune cells called macrophages, preventing them from cleaning up overwhelmed fat storage cells when a person is obese. "Obesity is fundamentally the manifestation of the enlargement of fat cells in the body that expand as they fill up with fats that are taken in from the diet. And we&#x2019;ve become interested in how macrophages change their activation state, when confronted by lipids that are present at high levels, most notably, in the context of obesity." Koliwad looked at both mouse and human macrophages, and found that saturated fats triggered a pathway to inflammation different than that activated by an infection. There may be something worth studying in terms of how obesity produces inflammation that might be able to get at the mechanism of how diabetes takes root. </description>

    <description>Researchers might have found a way to improve a powerful gene editing tool called CRISPR, which scientists hope can one day treat genetic disorders. According to microbiologist Benjamin Rauch of the University of California, San Francisco, the technology hasn't been precise enough and often makes mistakes. "CRISPR is not perfect. CRISPR will actually cut DNA in the wrong place, if we give it enough time to do so. You can't edit in the wrong place, because it will have some negative effects." So called anti-CRISPR proteins that Rauch and his colleagues recently discovered could stop CRISPR before it makes the wrong cut. The researchers basically used bacterial viruses to replicate what happens in nature. &#x201C;CRISPR's job in nature is to kill virus by cutting its DNA. So virus by encoding anti-CRISPR is able to fight back against CRISPR." Rauch says a safer and more accurate CRISPR brings scientists a step closer to developing an effective DNA-editing therapy in the future.</description>

    <description>In the last couple of years, droughts have killed millions of trees in California. This has raised some important questions for scientists: &#x201C;Under the global climatic change that we are experiencing, will we have to manage our forests in different ways? So for example, will we have to thin some of our forests, so the limited water resources that we have can keep at least some trees alive, But maybe not at the densities that our current forests are at." That&#x2019;s Todd Dawson, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley. He thinks that scientists need to work closely with governmental agencies to choose the best environmental strategies, especially when it comes to water. &#x201C;We need to really be paying attention to how we manage our water resources. So how do we regulate how much water goes to agriculture, goes to industry, does to supporting people? And then some of the water that we actually just leave alone because it feeds our forests, it feeds our natural ecosystems." Dawson hopes government will continue to support climate change research, so scientists can better detect and mitigate the negative impact of global warming.</description>

    <description>Everything that humans are used to on Earth changes in space and that&#x2019;s what astronauts should be prepared for during long space trips. &#x201C;You are now in microgravity, which means that you don&#x2019;t have these loads on not just your skeleton, but your skeletal muscle, your heart, your sense of balance.&#x201D; That's imaging scientist Thomas Lang, of the University of California, San Francisco. He explains that astronauts are exposed to a dangerous level of radiation, which increases the risk of cancer and brain damage. &#x201C;To some extent in lower Earth orbit we are protected by Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field, but once we go to, as proposed to these NASA missions, back to the Moon or to deep space habitats in cislunar orbit, there we are going to be exposed to solar, wind, as well as galactic heavy ion- radiation.&#x201D; Add to that isolation and the absence of daylight, and space travel might not seem so appealing. But researchers like Lang are working on strategies to make space trips a healthier experience.</description>

    <description>The meteorology of cloud formation is relatively well understood. Physical chemist Kevin Wilson of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory explains that&#x2019;s because it's pretty easy to predict when and where clouds will form in the atmosphere. "Conditions have the right temperature, the right amount of water vapor, but what's more uncertain, has been a challenge for models, for example, is to understand what I would call the microphysics, which is how do individual cloud droplets form." Wilson and his colleagues simulated the microphysics in the lab, using custom-built equipment to model cloud droplet formation. This gave them a much better understanding of what's going on at the microscopic level, which may improve the accuracy of climate change models. "We hope that we can develop more accurate predictions that ultimately can go into models, climate models, that hopefully long term, will give us more accurate predictions of the kinds of climate change processing we might expect in the future." </description>

    <description>Trying to influence behavior in public health campaigns can be tricky because education alone, while important, doesn't always change behavior. And so when it happens naturally, it's a big deal. In an encouraging sign in the fight against obesity, Kris Madsen of the University of California, Berkeley, found a 21 percent drop in the consumption of sugary drinks after the city of Berkeley, California implemented a penny-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. "Looking at the 21 percent drop to me is the most exciting finding of my career because it suggests that here's something that actually has a really big impact and it's incredibly simple and straightforward." Overall, the results suggest that a general excise tax like this, coupled with a public-awareness campaign, can have major benefits. "The other thing that we saw that was really promising in the study was people were drinking more water. So, it looks like people were switching from sugar-sweetened beverages to really what I would say is the healthiest alternative."</description>

    <description>Language and memory are actually interconnected. For decades, linguists were ignoring this fact, studying these two brain functions separately. Robert Knight, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has discovered the connection - now wants to know just how much memory and language interact. "One of our areas of research is defining the degree of that connectivity, how the brain rhythms in one area, the hippocampus, are coherent with brain rhythms in the language area. It's like two people dancing; are they in sync, right? Are they coherent?" These new findings will help scientists open up a whole new area of study with intracranial recordings. &#x201C;We might be able to use it as an early diagnostic tool, but more importantly it would open up the possibility that we could stimulate the brain to restore the proper brain rhythm." Knight says this study might also shed new light on diseases affecting language and memory - like autism, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. Studies show that about 10 percent of Americans are diagnosed with asthma each year. We spoke to a gastroenterologist Susan Lynch of UC San Francisco and learned that they&#x2019;ve been studying the microbiome to hone in on why asthma and allergies are so widespread in Western nations. She says some of the risk factors include a lack of a mother&#x2019;s exposure to livestock or furred pets while pregnant. "And so those risk factors suggest that these factors may influence the microbes and the communities of microbes that exist in humans and particularly in very early life." This understanding could lead to focusing more on changing a child&#x2019;s microbiological development very early in life. While at UCSF, we also chatted with Stanton Glantz a professor of medicine. Now that California has joined other states in the legalization of the recreational use of marijuana, Glantz suggests that public health experts be cautious about the negative effects of cannabis. "Kids think marijuana is harmless and even good for you. They start with marijuana and then move on to tobacco, so the marijuana and tobacco epidemics are really inextricably tied to each other." And finally, we reflect on the value of doing research within a university system &#x2013; it&#x2019;s something we hear about time and time again while interviewing researchers. Biomedical scientist Gabriela Loots of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory says her team has greatly benefited from having students and interdisciplinary faculty at their fingertips. "It&#x2019;s been working out great. With the UC Davis Cancer Center, we have started interacting with some of the scientists there because of my interest in prostate cancer and now we&#x2019;re growing to other types of cancer research and so we just started communicating with some of these scientists and we started collaborating."

    <description>Because of the recent holiday break, we didn&#x2019;t run our usual line-up this past week; instead we gave you a hint of the some of the stories to come. This includes an interview with UC San Diego&#x2019;s Dr. Dilip Jeste. He had some good news about aging and described how his study contradicts the conventional notions that aging is pretty much all &#x2018;gloom and doom&#x2019;. In this excerpt, Jeste describes what makes their study different. &#x201C;Usually, when people mention aging, they are thinking about physical aging, that's the only component that figures in ministries of aging, but aging is multidimensional. Physical health is one dimension. Another dimension is cognitive function, or cognitive health. So, that is what is being studied when we are looking at people with Alzheimer's Disease or other dementias. But the component of aging that is least studied is the psychosocial component of aging." So, Jeste took a multidimensional approach , which you'll want to hear about next week. And in another upcoming episode, we&#x2019;ll dial back the years to reflect upon adolescence. Adrianna Galvan of UCLA studies how changes in brain maturation during adolescence relate to adolescent behavior and decision-making. Here she describes why adolescence is often fraught with emotion. "There is probably an evolutionary reason for why teenagers are more emotional. One reason is that emotions help us connect with other people. And during adolescence, it's really important that we establish good relationships, or understand the social rules of interacting with others, of having romantic partners, and so the emotional reactivity helps adolescents in that regard.&#x201D; Don&#x2019;t miss these and many other stories about the latest research at the University of California.

    <description>It seems there&#x2019;s more to high-density lipoproteins, or HDLs, than we previously thought. Nutrition researcher Angela Zivkovic of the University of California, Davis, led an analyses of how the composition of complex sugars attached to HDLs called glycans are linked to the body&#x2019;s inflammatory response. Traditional markers like LDL cholesterol, body mass index and blood pressure are not able to predict whose HDL is pro- or anti-inflammatory. "That&#x2019;s something that had not really been looked at very extensively before. So, how can we actually start to look at people to see what their metabolic phenotype might be like that&#x2019;s something other than how we&#x2019;ve categorized them so far?&#x201D; Being a nutrition researcher, Zivkovic is looking into which diets are pro- or anti-inflammatory. "I think we can actually start to think about the possibility of giving people recommendations to improve their health that take into account both who they are as genetically, but also what they choose."</description>

    <description>A proof-of-concept study at the University of California, Berkeley has found promise in a pill-sized technology that could lead to painless oral vaccines. Aside from not having to deal with a needle anymore, we asked study leader Dorian Liepmann what are some of the other advantages of a system like this? "Well, the great thing is we can actually do this at home. You could give this to people so they don&#x2019;t need to go to a pediatrician. One of my co-investigators suggested that we could actually put this in a lollipop for children. And so they would just hold it in their mouth until the drug was delivered, and then they&#x2019;d have the rest of the lollipop. You don&#x2019;t need trained personnel to give you a shot, which is a huge expense. Also, for better distribution to Third World countries or to rural areas, you could actually get your vaccinations done very, very easily and effectively." The technology, called Mucojet, still needs to go through clinical trials, so it could be 5 to 10 years before it&#x2019;s available, but Liepmann says he and his team are very excited about its potential impact on healthcare.</description>

    <description>There&#x2019;s good ozone, and there&#x2019;s bad ozone. The good is high up in the stratosphere and the bad, a mixture of sunlight and nitrous oxide, is near the surface of the Earth. This pollution affects not only human health, but also plant growth. A research team led by Colin Carter of the University of California, Davis, has made a key discovery about how surface ozone impacts rice production. "There&#x2019;s a critical period during the growing season where you have a day of extremely high ozone, that it can reduce the yield up to 1 percent, just one day. So we measured across the country that yields could be reduced by two percent or more, which doesn&#x2019;t sound like a large number, but it is when you consider the fact that China is the world&#x2019;s largest producer of rice and the world&#x2019;s largest importer. By identifying this critical stage of development, Carter hopes their data can inform better regulatory policies in China to alleviate the damaging effects of ozone pollution on rice yields and ultimately, the global market.</description>

    <description>Over 40 million liters of donor blood are collected annually all over the world, but it is not enough to meet blood transfusion demands. On top of that, these donations don&#x2019;t last long. Blood cannot be stored for more than just a couple of days. So blood centers are in constant demand for new donors. But according to Mark Looney, a professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco this is not the only problem with donated blood. &#x201C;It seems like we are in an antiquated era of collecting blood from strangers, collecting mature cells from strangers and giving them as a transfusion." According to Looney, foreign blood can bring along viruses and bacteria to a recipient&#x2019;s body. That&#x2019;s a big risk. And that&#x2019;s why researchers are looking for new ways of getting blood to patients. &#x201C;So if we could come up with a more effective approach, maybe something that is cell based, than maybe it is going to be the way of the future.&#x201D; Looney says engineered blood cells from patients&#x2019; own bodies could be a better solution in modern medicine when it comes to blood transfusion or cell transplants.</description>

    <description>Wi-fi has become ubiquitous in our world as a wireless way to get access to the Internet, but what if radio waves could be used to sense the environment? Yasamin Mostofi, an electrical and computer engineer at the University of California, Santa Barbara has been using wi-fi signals to basically give x-ray vision to robots and unmanned vehicles. "Can they image objects? Can they see through walls? Can they count people? Can they localize people?" Such technology could be used in security, search and rescue scenarios, &#x2018;smart homes&#x2019; and even at archeological sites. "The robots basically have everyday wi-fi cards that we all have in our laptops and a directional antenna. So, one robot transmits and that transmission goes through the object and the objects interact with it, depending on their material property, their location. And in a sense we can see they leave a signature on a signal and that signature is what we&#x2019;re trying to use to figure out something about the object." </description>

    <description>Sometimes in medicine, there are compounds that are found to be good for one thing, but not so great for another. That seems to be the case when it comes to a class of anti-inflammatory drugs known as NSAIDs. These include pain relievers like ibuprofen. Aldrin Gomes of the University of California, Davis explains that NSAIDs are known to be linked to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. But they&#x2019;ve also found that NSAIDS seem to be beneficial in cancer. "In cancer, NSAIDS have been known to kill cancer cells. And it&#x2019;s killing cancer cells by a similar mechanism as it&#x2019;s killing the healthy cells, so it&#x2019;s actually too good at doing a job. So, it&#x2019;s ironic." Gomes and his team uncovered some of the reasons why NSAIDs can harm heart tissue &#x2013; including reducing the heart cells&#x2019; ability to produce energy. Yet, Gomes says there are some papers showing that NSAIDs can be used to treat cancer. "And the reason for that is that it&#x2019;s a similar mechanism as how it&#x2019;s actually damaging the heart cells."</description>

    <description>Should you enroll your children in preschool if you can provide a good early education for them at home? Parents struggling with this choice can find useful tips in a new study by Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley. &#x201C;We have known over the last half century that quality preschools can boost the early learning of children from poor families, but much less is known about the long-term effects of preschool on children from middle class families.&#x201D; For four years, Fuller tracked the academic performance of over six thousand children up to 5 years of age and found that kids from middle-class families did benefit from preschool. &#x201C;Those benefits tended to come from exposure to more academically intense preschool programs." Especially, in classes focused on developing verbal communication and early math skills. So maybe parents who prefer home education before their children hit elementary school age, should give pre-K a second thought?</description>

    <description>You&#x2019;ve probably heard about the human microbiome. But what about microbiomes growing in &#x201C;built environments&#x201D;? Jonathan Allen, a bioinformatics scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has been tapped to serve on a national panel to study these microbial communities to get a better sense of the design of buildings and how that may affect human health. "So, everywhere we go, our skin is contacting surfaces and shedding bacteria on building surfaces and then also it&#x2019;s coming from the natural environment, so you know plants and the outdoor environment. As the wind is blowing, it&#x2019;s actually bringing in bacteria, microbes and also fungi. You know, fungi has a big part in the human microbiome too, potentially. It&#x2019;s not nearly as pronounced as it is in building environments, where fungus can grow and actually become a major health issue for people." The panel will be conducting its study over the next 18 months. </description>

    <description>Did you know that researchers are developing new materials that can soak up excess drugs inside your body? Engineer Chelsea Chen of the University of California, Berkeley is building a polymer membrane that can absorb circulating chemotherapy drugs after treatment. The membrane is known as a ChemoFilter, and how it absorbs drugs depends on the materials inside it. "We study the structure-property relationship of the polymer membranes. So basically by establishing the structure-property relationships, we can predict what kind of structure would work best, so we could design the optimal performance membrane. That&#x2019;s our goal." When it comes to testing the filter, Chen is trying to create an environment similar to what the membrane would be exposed to within the body. "We are trying to improve the design to mimic body environment more closely, instead of just doing a simple benchtop experiment. So we&#x2019;re working on both a more real environment in vitro experiment and also the next step is the in vivo." </description>

    <description>An older generation antibiotic currently used in animals to reduce bacterial infections was found to block contemporary strains of Zika virus in human tissue in the lab. Dr. Lenore Pereira of the University of California, San Francisco joined forces with UC Berkeley to make this discovery. "What&#x2019;s interesting about this drug, it&#x2019;s called Duramycin, it&#x2019;s a small molecule inhibitor. And it works directly against the virus envelope &#x2013; it doesn&#x2019;t work against the cell. So it&#x2019;s very specific for Zika virus, Dengue, Ebola; I mean, we are thrilled about the finding." The drug blocked the transmission of Zika virus from mother to fetus from the two routes of infection Pereira helped discover; the placenta in the first trimester and the amniotic sac in the second. "Just this basic knowledge helps us now to ask other questions about what is the best way to reduce infection in a pregnant woman."</description>

    <description>Taking care of a loved one suffering from dementia is not an easy job. In fact, family members who look after sick relatives, often suffer from depression and could use some caregiving, too. That&#x2019;s according to Robert Levenson, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley. &#x201C;Part of it is just an understanding that this is really important, really prevalent and preventable in a way. We don&#x2019;t know how to cure dementia, but I think we can probably keep caregivers a lot more healthy.&#x201D; Levenson&#x2019;s recent study shows that depression of family caregivers may contribute to dementia patients&#x2019; earlier death. He suggests this is where social services can step in and help caregivers. &#x201C;We are talking about providing some health with making meals, letting caregivers have a few hours to get out of the house and maybe get some exercise. Some of these solutions to these problems are low-tech, not high-tech, low-cost, not high-cost." Dementia is a growing public health problem. Five million Americans have the disease and this number is expected to reach 8 million in just 15 years.</description>

    <description>The sight of farmers in China, bent over rice fields enveloped in air pollution, inspired researcher Colin Carter of the University of California, Davis to find out how surface ozone was impacting their most important crop. "You couldn&#x2019;t see from one end of the field to the other. And the sunlight wasn&#x2019;t even getting to the plants. So it sort of struck me that pollution today in China is a bigger issue for agriculture than climate change is. The two are related, but they are different." For the first time, Carter and his colleagues were able to identify a specific stage of a rice plant&#x2019;s development as being vulnerable to surface ozone, a form of pollution that&#x2019;s similar to smog. This information can be used to help the country implement regulatory policies to control surface ozone during critical stages of a rice plant&#x2019;s growth. "The factors that cause surface ozone also lead to climate change. So, if the pollution is controlled, not only will it give immediate benefit to agriculture, but it will also help in the battle against climate change."</description>

    <description>A rare disease that causes copper buildup in the liver has revealed how our bodies use the metal nutrient. To learn more about the link between copper and fat metabolism, researcher Chris Chang of the University of California, Berkeley studied mice suffering from a disorder also seen in humans. "The disease model that we used for the mouse studies is called Wilson&#x2019;s disease, and it&#x2019;s a rare genetic disorder that&#x2019;s directly related to the inability to handle copper in the body. So people who have this type of disease, they have a buildup of copper in the liver. It means that there&#x2019;s copper deficiency in other organs and tissues throughout the body." Chang hypothesized that this deficiency would have an impact on fat tissue and its metabolism as well. "And what we identified in the mice is that if you have too much copper in the liver, then you don&#x2019;t have enough copper in the fat tissue, then those fat tissues don&#x2019;t burn fat as well. And so there is a correlation between a rare, but real human disorder." Since there are high levels of metal nutrients in the brain, the next step is to look at copper and obesity in a neurological context. </description>

    <description>Are yogurt, kefir and other probiotics really good for you? Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, believe the benefits of these products may be overstated. Michael Cabana, a professor of pediatrics, came to this conclusion while trying to figure out if a probiotic strain called LGG helps prevent the development of eczema or asthma in kids predisposed to these diseases. &#x201C;At two years of age we found that there is no difference in eczema levels between the kids. Despite the fact that previous studies have shown this probiotic strain helps prevent eczema in other countries, in the San Francisco area we didn&#x2019;t find the same results.&#x201D; The UCSF findings further fuel the ongoing debate about the benefits of friendly bacteria in dietary supplements. &#x201C;We still learned a lot from this study and we still continue following these kids. It is probably more complicated than just giving a probiotic supplement.&#x201D; Genetic factors and other types of baby food, including breast milk, also affect a child&#x2019;s microbiota.

    <description>Wherever you are in the world, you receive a daily dose of radiation from the natural environment. That may sound intimidating if you&#x2019;re unfamiliar with the concept of background radioactivity. So to make the subject more tangible for the public, nuclear physicist Kai Vetter and his team at the University of California, Berkeley developed the DoseNet program, which uses a network of radiation sensors distributed to schools around the world. The DoseNet website displays real time measurements from these sensors that double as educational tools in the classroom. "Because it turns out, with nuclear radiation, even those we can&#x2019;t sense it, it&#x2019;s very easy to measure. Each of these sensor packages not only have the silicon sensor, which senses nuclear radiation, but it has a little computer on that to process the data and make the data ultimately available through our network." DoseNet&#x2019;s goal is to engage students in science and engineering through lessons on radiation. In fact, students can even analyze data and practice programming on these sensors, which Vetter hopes will someday form a sustainable, global network to monitor radiation. </description>

    <description>Over 5 million Americans, which is one in 10 people, age 65 and older suffer from dementia. The disease takes its toll not only on patients, but on their caregivers, too. &#x201C;Probably the most common thing these days is that the care of patients with dementia largely falls on a spouse or family members. Among caregivers the rates of depression are about 4 times as high as they are among non-caregiving adults at that age group. So it really is a dramatic increase." That&#x2019;s psychologist Robert Levenson of the University of California, Berkeley. His new study shows that if a family caregiver is stressed or depressed, it contributes to a faster decline of the loved one with dementia. &#x201C;If you are being cared for by quite depressed person, you are going to live on average by about 14 months less than if you are being cared for by a person who is not very depressed. This is a significant shortening of life." By 2030, rates of dementia will rise to 8 million, making this a pressing national public health challenge.</description>

    <description>A 3D bioprint of &#x2018;living&#x2019; blood vessels may change the way researchers do biology. This, according to bioengineer Monica Moya of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Moya led a project that used a 3D printer and a &#x2018;bio-ink&#x2019; to successfully print structures with living cells and biomaterials. "We use the word &#x2018;ink&#x2019;, but it&#x2019;s not quite an ink. It&#x2019;s really just kind of a gel-like material that the cells are inside of. The challenge with what we&#x2019;re doing is we&#x2019;re actually printing the cells with the material, this gel-like substance. Other people will print just the scaffolding and they&#x2019;ll use just the material and then they&#x2019;ll add the cells later on. The difference is that when you don&#x2019;t print he cells with the material, you&#x2019;re losing that ability to control where the cells are going to be spatially." The hope is that their &#x2018;living blood vessels&#x2019; may someday literally feed the end goal of 3D bioprinting &#x2013; that is, the ability to print organs and tissues. "So what you need in order to really make these 3D strucgtures, is a vasculature." </description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. Pain isn&#x2019;t just one sensation: we can ache, burn or sting. And these experiences often involve different pathways, some of which remain a mystery. So to learn more, researcher Jeremiah Osteen of the University of California, San Francisco looked to tarantula venom, and discovered two toxins that can target highly specific pain pathways. "And so what the toxins have given us the ability to do is to look very specifically at this particular type of pain pathway, to have a better understanding of what types of neurons are involved, what types of molecules are involved, in order to design better pain drugs." We also tackle the subject of pain-relief, and hear from UC Davis professor Aldrin Gomes, who studies a common type anti-inflammatory drug know as NSAIDs. Because the chronic use of pain relievers can actually increase a person&#x2019;s risk of cardiovascular problems and stroke, Gomes decided to investigate further. "So we first did a screen of different NSAIDs to see if any of them would affect cardiac cells. And to our surprise, all the NSAIDs we tested affected the heart cells." From these topics in life sciences, we move on to learn about computer network security. Domingo Colon of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory tells us about a new comprehensive tool called NeMS that&#x2019;s built to improve the digital security at government agencies. "So there are a lot of tools out there that provide different vantage points of network security, but what we needed was something a lot more specific that told us behaviorally what&#x2019;s happening on our network, and also structurally, how is the composition of our network put together at any point in time."

    <description>About 10 to 25 thousand cases of stroke, aneurysm or epilepsy may go undetected each year in the United States. This, according to Anthony Kim, director of the University of California, San Francisco Stroke Center. Kim has been studying misclassified cases of neurological death, which were erroneously thought to be sudden cardiac death. "If you think about the deaths that occur, for instance, in patients that are enrolled in clinical trials or patients that die out-of-hospital, before they can even make it to the hospital, it would account for a substantial proportion of those cases. So, it has kind of implications on the public health estimates. It has implications on the interpretations of death outcomes, in large cardiovascular trials." Kim says it also has implications on diagnosis, as well as the way medical experts look at the risks and benefits of cardiovascular treatment, such as blood thinners.

    <description>What if researchers could turn a diseased cell into a healthy one by simply reprogramming its genes? Using a type of adeno-associated virus, a popular tool in gene therapies, a team at the University of California, San Francisco was able to transform cirrhosis-causing liver cells into normal ones within the body of a mouse. Study leader Milad Rezvani says that adding healthy cells to a diseased liver is not an easy task, so the prospect of gene therapy offers a safe and possibly more efficient alternative. "Diseased livers are actually not a good target for cells to be transplanted &#x2013; they don&#x2019;t engraft well." A gene delivery vehicle like a virus provided a way to do this without surgery or cell transplantation. "They can be used because they are safe. These are so-called adeno-associated viruses, which are gene vehicles packaged in viruses that do not integrate into the host genome. As a matter of fact, there are ongoing clinical trials using the kind of virus that we used." </description>

    <description>One of the current limitations of commercial 3D printers on the market is the lack of material that&#x2019;s being used. Mostly it&#x2019;s thermoplastics, like ABS. So what researchers would like to do is expand the materials used to fabricate devices or functional materials. Engineer Chen Zhu of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory says they teamed up with the University of California, Santa Cruz to do just that. What they came up with was a novel, ultra-lightweight graphene aerogel. "Graphene is a very unique material, so first we developed the graphene aerogel ink that&#x2019;s a printable ink. So, that means the material is easy to flow through the very small nozzle and after squeezing the printing, the material can maintain the shape and it&#x2019;s not going to shrink or collapse or deform. It can maintain whatever shape we print it and then we can do the heat treatment to get very good performance of the graphene." The team also modified the technique to minimize clogging during printing.</description>

    <description>Virtual Reality becomes a reality in medical research. Derek Harmon, a professor of anatomy at the University of California, San Francisco, is working with software companies to develop 3D brain scan visualization tools. &#x201C;With your two hand-held controllers of the virtual space you can slice with one axes and then the other and see a view of a head CT scan. In real time you can see all these different angles and again, build on special arrangement of the body, which I don&#x2019;t know where else you can even do something like that.&#x201D; Harmon has just started a pilot curriculum that offers virtual reality anatomy classes to medical students, so a 360-degree view of a digital human body using Google glasses. Harmon says lessons like these will help students become better physicians in the future. &#x201C;If you have a company that built the software for you, you have pre-selected layers of tissue, organs and whatever you want to learn from, which does a lot of legwork for you and because of that people can start experimenting with it. I think it is so early on in the technology, but there is a lot of promise on things that you really can&#x2019;t do on another type of medium."</description>

    <description>There&#x2019;s long been an assumption that the mental health of older people mirrors their declining physical and cognitive function. But according to a University of California, San Diego study, despite physical ailments, aging adults seem to get better over time. In the same study, Dilip Jeste found high levels of depression and anxiety among adults in their 20s and 30s. It made him wish that there were more studies looking into the value of intergenerational activities. "There has been some work of that kind in the past, but I think we need larger scale, better studies in which you can have younger people having an older person, and they become partners or a team with mentorship in both directions. The younger ones are teaching the older ones, let&#x2019;s say, about technology; and the older ones are teaching the younger ones about how to live life and so on. And we need to measure the outcomes in terms of not just their satisfaction, but even biological measures." And this would help develop broader interventions to promote mental health in all age groups.</description>

    <description>Age matters when it comes to spotting the warning signs of memory decline and other thinking skills. Kristine Yaffe, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco, has been studying a group of young adults from 18 to 30 years old, until they've reached midlife. And in doing so, Yaffe observed some of their weakening brain activity. "If you just study people when they are in their eighties and nineties with dementia, that's very helpful in terms of trying to come up with better treatment and better care of patients, but it's not very helpful if you are trying to prevent or really try to intervene early. For that you have to back up the time, probably by decades and really get a better understanding of some of the early signs and the early risk factors." Yaffe found other factors, like alcohol use, depression and poverty, also contribute to mental decline. The good news is, it&#x2019;s not too late &#x2013; that changes in lifestyle may help these people prevent dementia later in life.</description>

    <description>Can you trick your genes into extending your life? Biologist Andrew Dillin of the University of California, Berkeley recently found two genes in the worm C.elegans that are affected by their diet during early development. Changes in the expression of these genes can actually alter the worms&#x2019; metabolism later on in life and sometimes even double their lifespan. "And that was very exciting, that basic finding that these genes do actually exist, and when we manipulate them, we could block this event. Or if we could turn them on, we could trick the system into thinking that they were metabolically stressed or metabolically altered, and they would end up living twice as long, for example." Dillin says future studies are needed to determine the relationship between these genes and longevity in humans. "If that correlation existed, it may actually predict if you could make a drug that could activate these genes. For example, a person that is predicted to be short-lived, maybe we could actually increase their life span so they would have a healthy normal life span, you know, grow up and be able to see their grandkids." </description>

    <description>Want to know how our brain is formed and what causes changes in its structure? You could look at a mini-brain&#x2026;this is emerging 3D technology created from stem cells. &#x201C;Mini brains allow you to ask some questions that are more challenging to ask about a single cell essentially in isolation, vs. what happens when cells are moving in a three-dimensional space and interacting with each other in three-dimensions as well.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s neurologist Lauren Weiss of the University of California, San Francisco. She has been studying brain disorders in the lab by looking at neurons grown from skin cells. Weiss says a mini brain is the next step in research because it re-creates the structure of a real brain. &#x201C;It is layers of cells that have different kinds of structures and functions, ultimately.&#x201D; Using mini-brains Weiss hopes to study micro- and macrocephaly, autism and other developmental disorders.</description>

    <description>If your children have mental health problems, their physical health might suffer, too. But psychiatrist Nicole Bush of the University of California, San Francisco, say this connection is often overlooked because of lack of research and funding in this field. "A lot of people are less motivated to support and provide funding to improve the mental health of children, a lot of people point to parents as being responsible for caring for that outcome. But when people realize that a child has an immune system problem that maybe affecting their metabolic profile, increasing their risk for obesity, their risk for infectious illness or asthma or other airway health outcomes, they start to be more concerned." Bush thinks all this may be a result of a psychological trauma or multiple adverse events in a child's life. She is currently analyzing data from her recent study to prove this point. "It has large societal impact. So, if we can identify harmful biological marks associated with that adversity, people maybe more motivated to invest in interventions for these populations".</description>

    <description>It&#x2019;s hard enough feeling under the weather on terra firma, so imagine how it must be for astronauts in Deep Space. We spoke to a senior research scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who is helping NASA develop a handheld medical diagnostic device for space travel. Matthew Coleman says it may even contain biomarkers for radiation sensitivity, which is a concern in microgravity since there is much higher levels of radiation beyond our atmosphere. "And so if you&#x2019;re somebody that&#x2019;s more sensitive to radiation exposure, you may not want to go out on too many spacewalks and you may need to limit those sorts of activities and therefore, somebody else will have to complete that mission requirement." Meanwhile, researchers at UC San Francisco are calling for access to a good education in the hopes of preventing dementia and other mental problems affecting memory and thinking. Psychiatrist Kristine Yaffe has made a connection between poverty and dementia later in life. She says people with higher income usually get a better education than those who struggle financially, so improving the quality of education would be a great start. "Even if you have the same number of years of education, the quality of education may not be as good." And while on the UC San Francisco campus, we visited Dr. Anthony Kim at the School of Medicine to talk about stroke, which affects almost 800 thousand Americans every year. He explains that not all of these patients fully recover and says doctors need to put more effort into helping stroke patients get better. "Most of our interventions post-stroke are geared towards preventing the next stroke and we have relatively fewer interventions that are geared toward actually improving the recovery."

    <description>Social connections are important and can make you happier, according to psychologist Iris Mauss of the University of California, Berkeley. But how can those who are, shall we say, not so easy going build such a network? Mauss says &#x2013; just be yourself, and open up to others. &#x201C;People who are perceived to be more authentic are better liked by others and have better social connections. And we have found that if you hold in your emotions, you stifle them, then others tend to perceive that as.. on average, finding you less authentic.&#x201D; Mauss says accepting your negative emotions could also help you become more personable. &#x201C;Having that accepting attitudes about your own emotions will make you be more open about your own emotions which I believe would be perceived by others as greater authenticity.&#x201D; So, if you shy away from sharing your feelings, just give it another try!</description>

    <description>One way to improve healthcare in America may be to change just how doctors take care of their patients. This, according to Dr. Anna Chang of the University of California, San Francisco. Chang helped develop a new curriculum called Bridges that aims to teach medical students an array of critical skills, including how to better communicate with patients. "About 20 years ago, the Institute of Medicine stated that too many people die every year because the process of medicine is not perfect. Sometimes we think that maybe the most important decisions in medicine are - which medications to prescribe or which surgeries to perform, but that is actually not true. Our patients are a lot safer and a lot healthier, they are much more informed when we hear and speak with each other effectively&#x201D;. To achieve that, from the first days of school, physicians, nurses, social workers and even patients meet with students &#x2013; to share their stories and give them advice on how to work together as a team.</description>

    <description>This is Science Today. Low calorie diets in the early lives of some animals have long been associated with metabolic changes that increase lifespan. In experiments on mice and worms known as C.elegans, biologist Andrew Dillin of the University of California, Berkeley and his team uncovered two critical genes responsible for these striking changes. Dillin&#x2019;s laboratory also discovered that these metabolic shifts are caused by genetic switches, or enzymes that can control these genes and be manipulated by the researchers as well. "These genes are the number one correlation of extreme longevity. So the ones that are long-lived have these two genes very highly upregulated, and the animals that are short-lived have these two genes downregulated." Basically, the long-lived organisms express these genes more than the short-lived ones. These observations may also reflect aging in humans. "The next step is, can we begin to look at super centenarians, people that are living well into their hundreds. Do they have alterations in these genes that people that are only living to be 80 or 70 don&#x2019;t have?" For Science Today, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin. </description>

    <description>This week on Science Today &#x2013; we looked into how race and ethnicity affect health. Noah Zaitlen at the University of California, San Francisco, describes the connection they found in their new research. "People from different countries, from different communities, get sick from different diseases, they respond differently to different medications. We know that some of that is because of differences in their genetics and some of that is because of differences in their environment." And that includes exposure to pollution or differences in diet or stress levels &#x2013; all of which doctors and scientists alike overlooked in the past in favor of genetics and ancestry. So Zaitlen hopes doctors will start including this information in their usual form, as it's a better way to assess a patient&#x2019;s health. And on the subject of patients and health, wouldn&#x2019;t it be wonderful if cancer patients did not suffer from the systemic toxicity of chemotherapy? We talked to a materials scientist Chelsea Chen at the Berkeley Lab who has been collaborating with a UCSF physician to design a device to do just that. "What he came up with is that he wants to place this device at the draining vein exiting the tumor, so this device can catch the excessive chemotherapy before it enters the body circulation and this way, it further reduces the systemic toxicity of the drugs. So we designed this device that we call the ChemoFilter." Hopefully this will be ready for treatment in a few years. And finally, do you snack a lot during the day? If so, your teeth are at risk. Dr. Peter Rechmann of the UCSF School of Dentistry says one tip to reduce cavities is to eat fast. "We kept on telling our patients you can have chocolate, no problem, eat the whole thing in 10 minutes and brush your teeth or use chewing gum, but don&#x2019;t eat the chocolate over, piece-by-piece, ever 10 minutes a piece. That is terrible." The problem is, it leaves more sugar for bacteria in your mouth. For you snackers out there one tip is to munch on nuts &#x2013; Rechmann says it&#x2019;s one of the safest snacks because there&#x2019;s not a lot of sugar for bacteria and it kills your hunger pangs pretty fast. So, how&#x2019;s that for food for thought? To hear more University of California research stories, subscribe to Science Today on iTunes or follow us on Soundcloud or Facebook.

    <description>Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men and women combined in the United States. And yet, only about 50 percent of individuals who are recommended to get screened, do so. Dr. Judy Yee of the University of California, San Francisco is a pioneer of the use of CT colonography, or virtual colonoscopy. This less-invasive technology recently scored high marks. "On June 15, the U.S. Preventative Service Task Force released their final recommendation for colorectal screening and they included CT colonography under their A rating. That means that every insurance company in this country will have to cover CT colonography for screening. And this is great news for patients. I think it will really provide improved access to patients who have been hesitant to come in for colorectal cancer screening because they don't want an invasive technique." This will hopefully lead to Medicare reimubursement, too.</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. Did you know that nearly 40 percent of worldwide agricultural crops are destroyed by insects &#x2013; in particular, fruit flies such as the spotted-wing Drosophila. These pests feed on ripening fruits, laying eggs inside berries and causing hundreds of millions of dollars&#x2019; worth of agricultural damage. According to UC Riverside entomologist Anandasankar Ray, most flies go for rotting fruits that have fallen off plants. "But these flies will go after the ripening fruit. So this is of particular concern because when you have fruit or produce that is close to harvest, you really do not want to spray toxic chemicals on them." Ray describes a safe repellent they&#x2019;ve developed, which successfully warded off hungry flies in the lab. Also in the lab, this one at UC Berkeley, we talk to engineer Chelsea Chen who is testing how their ChemoFilter works in a natural environment. This is a polymer membrane that can absorb excess, circulating chemotherapy drugs in one&#x2019;s body after treatment. "We are trying to improve the design to mimic body environment more closely instead of just doing a simple benchtop experiment. So, we&#x2019;re working on both a more real environment in vitro experiment and also the next step is the in vivo." And at UC San Francisco, doctors are seeing things in a whole new way &#x2013; literally. Dr. Judy Yee describes how they&#x2019;re using virtual holography to perform colonoscopies and how this technology may also be applied to other parts of the body and help surgeons prepare for procedures. "It will allow surgeons to get a sense of the size of lesions, the proximity to key structures like vessels and to potentially practice the approach to a tumor, for example." There&#x2019;s just so much going on at the University of California &#x2013; keep on top of all the latest discoveries and breakthroughs. Subscribe to UC Science Today on iTunes or Stitcher.

    <description>Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, might be close to finding a drug that could cure glaucoma, which is the world&#x2019;s second-leading cause of blindness. Karsten Gronert, a professor of optometry, says it has been a long process of trial and error. "With decades worth of research there have been several approaches to try to develop neuroprotective drugs that somehow can stop once you see neurodegenerartion. And there have been several approaches and none of them actually were able to stop the progression of neurodegeneration." But Gronert discovered that astrocytes - cells in the eye retina - produce lipid signals that protect nerves from damage. And when the eye is stressed, the astrocytes stop making the protective signal. "It was an unexpected finding. This means it has some unknown role with nerves that we were not aware of." So, if researchers can find a way to protect astrocytes, they might get on the right track to fight glaucoma.</description>

    <description>Studies of alcohol abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, are mostly focused on male soldiers, while female military members are often excluded. Jennifer Mitchell, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco explains why. &#x201C;So you can imagine that female subjects that have alcohol use disorder and comorbid PTSD are individuals that have experienced rape or other forms of domestic abuse. And those individuals might respond very well to a drug like intranasal oxytocin, but it&#x2019;s a very hard subject population for us to identify. &#x201D; In a recent study, Mitchell used oxytocin to treat military personnel suffering from depression and anxiety. So far the experimental therapy has been successful, but the results were skewed as only male combat members participated. &#x2018;&#x2019;We&#x2019;d love to have good access to that population because then we could perhaps study the effects of intranasal oxytocin in a group of female subjects that have alcohol or substance- use disorder and comorbid PTSD.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>While tarantula venom contains many different toxins, recent research at the University of California, San Francisco has identified two that can activate pain-sensing neurons. To prove their effectiveness, researcher Jeremiah Osteen synthesized the toxins individually. "Having access to a synthetic toxin, you&#x2019;re able to make it in very large quantities, whereas you would otherwise have to milk lots of spiders, and that&#x2019;s both labor intensive and these spiders aren&#x2019;t always easy to come by. So once you identify what you think is the toxin that&#x2019;s causing your activity, you want to go and synthesize that and be able to show that you can recapitulate the activity without having to purify it directly from the venom." These two toxins can selectively manipulate pain fibers. One of them targeted nerve fibers not previously linked to any pain pathways. "How might these fibers be involved in different types of chronic pain disorders, and ultimately, can we tweak the chemistry of the toxin to be able to manipulate these fibers differently?" </description>

    <description>Do you dread getting vaccinations because of the needle? Well, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have developed what could be a game-changer for vaccinations. Dorian Liepmann, a professor of mechanical and bioengineering says their needleless technology is called MucoJet, and it&#x2019;s designed to self-administer vaccines. "What we have is a pill that actually shoots a jet of drug into your cheek without pain. We use a reaction in here just like vinegar and baking soda. Once that starts reacting, it makes a gas and builds up the pressure inside of the pill. On the end of the nozzle, we have a membrane that holds the pressure in and when it gets to a certain pressure, it releases. This piston pushes down, pushes the drug out and it shoots a jet of the drug into the cheek." Right now, this is a proof-of-concept study, but Liepmann hopes it will be available within the next five to ten years. "The next step is actually a smaller pill and this one&#x2019;s actually designed to be swallowed. One of the target possibilities would be insulin for diabetics &#x2013; swallow a pill versus having to take an injection."</description>

    <description>Hi there &#x2013; I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin, host of Science Today and it&#x2019;s that time of the week again where we go over some of the stories covered this past week. First, we learned that by the end of the century climate change will likely cause a decline in wheat and barley yields by up to 33 percent. This statistical model was developed by a team of researchers led by UC Davis. Graduate student Matthew Gammans, who worked on the study, told us it was based on 65 years of weather records and data from wheat and barley yields in France.&#xA0; &#x201C;So we started by looking at the relationship between weather and yields and then using some climate change projections, we forecasted that relationship into the future to see what we can expect to happen to these yields.&#x201D; Their work is one of the first flexible statistical models applied to these cereal crops, which means that every potential temperature was included in the analysis. We then chatted with public health professor Kristine Madsen of UC Berkeley about soda consumption in the U.S. falling to a 31-year low last year. Instead, consumers seem to be reaching for lower-calorie produces, including bottled water. Madsen had found similar findings in Berkeley, California after the city passed the nation&#x2019;s first soda tax back in 2014. &#x201C;Even in the comparison cities of Oakland and San Francisco, there was an overall increase of 20 percent in water consumption. But it was 63 percent in Berkeley. So, it looks like people were switching from sugar-sweetened beverages to really what I would say is the healthiest alternative.&#x201D; Speaking of healthy alternatives, there&#x2019;s even more reason to never start smoking. We learned that even if parents quit before conception, their prior smoking habit may still put their child&#x2019;s health at risk. UC San Francisco researcher Adam de Smith studied dust in homes where children were diagnosed with leukemia and found an increased level of tobacco particles in the carpeting. &#x201C;If a family is smoking relatively heavily, they might not even be smoking in the house, they might be smoking outside, but when they come into the home, particles drop onto the carpet. If they have children several years later, we have found that those particles can remain there several years later. So it is possible if a child is playing around on the carpet, he may still be exposed to toxic particles that could perhaps increase the leukemia risk.&#x201D; And even frequently vacuuming does not eliminate all the dust. So again &#x2013; all the more reason to never pick up the habit. Well, that&#x2019;s all for now.

    <description>The treatment of concussions has not been well-defined, and it&#x2019;s sometimes controversial. So radiologist Pratik Mukherjee of the University of California, San Francisco is calling for more studies and a better understanding from doctors and researchers. &#x201C;Some people recommend cognitive rest, where you stay away from doing any intense physical or mental activities, stay away from bright lights and loud noises for several days. Some of the more resent studies are saying, well, maybe this is not quite the right approach. People should try to return to their regular activities as soon as they can and stay active and that would be better for leaving the symptom of concussion and doing better long term.&#x201D; Mukherjee has been studying injured brains with advanced MRI scanners, which he believes could help solve some of the mystery about concussions. &#x201C;The methods to do cognitive training, cognitive rehabilitation in the areas that are affected by concussions, namely attention, memory, decision making are improving all the time. &#x201D;</description>

    <description>Stem cells studies have been controversial, but once scientists started using adult cells, instead of embryos, their experiments became more acceptable. Neurologist Lauren Weiss of the University of California, San Francisco, says with technological advancements, researchers are now facing new challenges. "A lot of the current public debates are around gene editing technologies, so we are not actively using those in the labs now. But I think that&#x2019;s where I think some of the concern has shifted. So with this new ability to make a change in someone&#x2019;s genome, if it is done at a very early stage of development, it could affect every generation from there on out.&#x201D; Weiss, who is studying brain disorders using neurons grown out of stem cells, thinks that researchers can use gene editing without ethical implications. "But that is sort of a thought of where it could go in the future, where we sort of need to be prepared to think about what are the limitations that we want to impose and need to impose.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>When it comes to teens, sometimes overparenting, or exerting too much influence, may interfere with their ability to learn from consequences. "The brain is very responsive to the environment that it develops as based on feedback from the environment. So, if an adolescent is not experiencing consequences or decision-making on their own, or goal-setting on their own, then that is limiting how well the prefrontal cortex is developing in response to those activities or behaviors. That&#x2019;s Adrianna Galv&#xE1;n, director of UCLA&#x2019;s Developmental Neuroscience Lab. One of her studies found that the brain&#x2019;s reward center is hyperactive during adolescence. "And because we know that the reward center is also where learning occurs, we were interested in testing the hypothesis that teenagers would also show greater activation in this region in response to learning, and greater than adults." Their study found this to be the case and underscores the value of adolescents learning from behaviors and associations.</description>

    <description>It&#x2019;s been another busy week for us here at Science Today. During a visit at the University of Calfornia, San Francisco, we learned that about 10 to 25 thousand cases of stroke, aneurysm or epilepsy may go undetected each year. Anthony Kim, director of UCSF&#x2019;s Stroke Center has been studying misclassified cases of neurological death, which were erroneously thought to be sudden cardiac death. "So, it has kind of implications on the public health estimates, it has implications on the interpretations of death outcomes, in large cardiovascular trials." And it also has implications on diagnosis. And while on the subject of diagnosis &#x2013; the rates of childhood asthma and allergies are on the rise in this country, so if you want to lessen your child&#x2019;s risk, you may want to consider getting a dog. Susan Lynch, a gastroenterologist at UCSF made this connection while studying microbes in newborn babies&#x2019; bodies. "Exposure in early life to a greater breadth of organisms seems to be beneficial and allows the system to accumulate a greater diversity of organisms, which really means a greater diversity of the microbial functions." In other words, a mixture of home dust and a dog&#x2019;s dander can help a child become immune to asthma later in life, especially if the pet is brought home when a child is no older than one month. And finally, we crossed the bridge into Berkeley to speak with a cognitive neuroscientist there, who has found that language and memory are actually interconnected. Robert Knight says for decades linguists were ignoring this fact and studying these two brain functions separately. "One of our areas of research is defining the degree of that connectivity; how the brain rhythms in one area, the hippocampus, are coherent with brain rhythms in the language area, like two people dancing. Are they in synch, right? Are they coherent?" To hear these and other episodes about the latest University of California research, tune into Science Today on iTunes or follow us on Soundcloud.

    <description>This week on Science Today. It&#x2019;s been over a year since the city of Berkeley, California implemented a &#x2018;soda tax&#x2019; and a team of UC Berkeley public health researchers took the opportunity to see how it has impacted consumption. Kris Madsen of the School of Public Health says they found a 21 percent drop in the consumption of soda and other sugary beverages in the Berkeley&#x2019;s low-income neighborhoods, which is an encouraging sign in the fight against obesity, especially in areas hit hard by the consequences of obesity and diabetes. "It&#x2019;s the kind of evidence that we really want because what we&#x2019;re trying to find are tools that can change people&#x2019;s behaviors. Education alone has not been effective but if this is a really effective tool, then it&#x2019;s a tool we need to use." And on the subject of tools, UC San Francisco physicians are using holograms, or 3D images formed by the inference of light beams from a laser, in about 20 percent of their CT colonography cases. Dr. Judy Yee says the goal is to appeal to patients to prevent disease. "But also, to make it easier for the radiologists who interpret these studies to make it engaging and easier and as accurate, if not more accurate." Speaking of accurate studies, it&#x2019;s been over 40 years since atmospheric scientist V. Ramanathan of UC San Diego&#x2019;s Scripps Institution of Oceanography predicted how the earth&#x2019;s climate would change by 2010. And while his accurate model continued to show further warming, Ramanathan says we can still &#x2018;bend the curve&#x2019; in this chart if we take collective measures now. "We have the science and we have the technology. This is where the intitiatives taken in California could shine a brightest light possible on this problem &#x2026; to mitigate climate change by using solar fuel cells and waste gas can provide like a beacon for the nation and for the planet to follow."

    <description>People often don&#x2019;t pay much attention to small brain injuries suffered in a minor car collision or after accidentally falling and hitting their head. But these types of traumas should not be ignored. &#x201C;There is a significant minority ranging from anywhere from 1/5 to 1/3 of people who have what&#x2019;s called persistent post-concussive syndrome where for months or even years after the injury they have continued problems like headaches, dizziness, insomnia, depression, problems with thinking." That&#x2019;s Pratik Mukherjee, a professor of radiology at the University of California, San Francisco. Small brain injuries often go undetected by traditional MRI scans. But Mukherjee may have found a solution. &#x201C;We are trying to develop better MRI methods for diagnosing these concussions.&#x201D; They&#x2019;re using more advanced image capturing technology, which may allow researchers to predict if injured people continue experiencing symptoms later in life.</description>

    <description>Do specific words activate certain regions of the brain? In a study funded by the National Science Foundation, neuroscientist Alexander Huth of the University of California, Berkeley imaged the brains of subjects while they listened to a radio show, then created a language map from the results. While playing a second episode of the show, the researchers were often able to predict which areas of the brain would respond to particular words. "The aspect of language that we've been investigating is mostly semantics, which is the sort of meaning of language. And it turns out that different topics or different groups of meanings seem to be represented in different parts of the brain." Although language maps can vary by person, Huth was surprised to see similar maps across different participants. "Certainly, we want to scan more people. We want to see how this generalizes to other people." Huth hopes this concept can someday be reversed, allowing us to predict words from brain activity, such as in the case of stroke patients. </description>

    <description>What&#x2019;s the best way to treat people suffering from substance abuse? Jennifer Mitchell, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, has been studying the hormone oxytocin as a possible cure for addictions, due to its ability to reduce stress, anxiety and social discomfort. &#x201C;By enabling people to make better social connections and by attenuating the craving for that other substance or act, or giving them a better set of tools with which to embark on this road to recovery, and it is not that it is to say that it is like a panacea: you are going to take a little intranasal oxytocin and everything is going to be perfect, but perhaps it could be one of many tools that people use to get better and get back into a healthy life style.&#x201D; Mitchell says oxytocin could be a substitute for those self-medicating with alcohol, opioids or even gambling. &#x201C;Whether or not it is related to depression or stress or anxiety or PTSD, the bottom line is they are experiencing the state of despair.&#x201D; Mitchell hopes doctors will start offering oxytocin as a therapy.</description>

    <description>Parents who used to smoke, but quit before conceiving, may still put their child&#x2019;s heath at risk. Researchers of the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Francisco, have studied dust in homes where children were diagnosed with leukemia and found an increased level of tobacco particles in the carpeting. UCSF Associate Researcher Adam de Smith explains the connection. &#x201C;If a family is smoking relatively heavily, they might not even be smoking in the house, they might be smoking outside, but when they come into the home, particles drop onto the carpet. If they have children several years later, we have found that those particles can remain there several years later. So it is possible if a child is playing around on the carpet, he may still be exposed to toxic particles that could perhaps increase the leukemia risk." Studies show that even if you don&#x2019;t smoke inside the house and frequently vacuum, only about 10 percent of dust gets removed. So de Smith says, best way to protect your children from tobacco-contaminated dust exposure is to never start smoking.</description>

    <description>If you suffer from deficiencies in the bone marrow, a tissue in our body that produces blood cells, your lungs can come to the rescue. That&#x2019;s according Mark Looney, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. &#x201C;It is curious that when patients get a bone marrow transplant or a stem cell transplant, those cells are given intravenously and the first place that they go is the lung. So it could be that the lung is part of a cycle here that is necessary for the maturation of these cells and their normal function&#x201D;. In his recent study Looney discovered that about 50 percent of platelets are produced directly in the lungs, inside the cells called megakaryocytes. So how will this finding help patients? &#x201C;Perhaps we can come up with a strategy where we give them megakaryocytes transfusions, and then we put them back in to the vein and they do their natural thing, they go back to the lung and there they produce platelets.&#x201D; That could be a new way of treatment for patients with a low level of platelets.</description>

    <description>A specific protein has been found to inhibit prostate cancer metastasis to the bone, which is where aggressive forms of the disease primarily spread. Study leader Gabriela Loots, a biomedical scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, collaborated with researchers from University of California campuses at Merced and Davis. "We were curious about what is it about the bone and what kinds of signals may the bone be sending out that may attract cancer cells to migrate to the bone and then form very aggressive tumors." The team found that bone cells that were deficient in a secreted bone protein called sclerostin tended to create an environment that&#x2019;s attractive to cancer cells to go there and grow. One of the things that we&#x2019;re interested in now is if we were to combine the antibody as a therapy, if that would potentially have some kind of beneficial outcome to these aggressive cancers that may be highly metastatic. So that would be something we&#x2019;re interested in further investigating &#x2013; to see can we can block metastasis?" </description>

    <description>Every year, almost 800 thousand Americans have a stroke, but not all patients fully recover. Anthony Kim, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine says doctors should put more effort into helping stroke patients get better. &#x201C;Most of our interventions post-stroke are geared towards preventing the next stroke and we have relatively fewer interventions that are geared toward actually improving the recovery.&#x201D; One way to fix this is to focus on therapies, which, as Kim says, is a huge unmet need. "That&#x2019;s the question that patients ask after they have had the stroke. I mean they want to improve from the stroke that&#x2019;s already occurred." Kim says a way to address this is if more patients enrolled in clinical studies. Her says this would help doctors develop and choose the right treatments.</description>

    <description>Did you ever wonder what happens in the brain when we finish our friends' sentences or answer fill-in-the-blank questions? A University of California, Berkeley study has found that while looking for the right words, we engage our hippocampus, an area of the brain that stores our memories. Cognitive neuroscientist Robert Knight says that until now, linguists were not paying attention to this connection. "What's happened historically is the language has operated independent of the memory field. We have the metaphor that two ships are sailing. You had a language ship sailing and a memory ship sailing. Turns out they are getting berthed at the same port." This discovery allows scientists to take a closer look at abnormalities in the brain rhythms and this may help patients with different types of brain disorders. "It might give us some insight as to whether your kid is going down a wrong language development path or it might give us some idea about the problems with accessing semantic knowledge in older person - either which is age- related cognitive decline or maybe something portending or having Alzheimer's disease."</description>

    <description>Opposites attract even in your blood stream. Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have teamed up with the University of California, San Francisco to develop a new device that soaks up excess chemotherapy drugs after treatment. The goal is to reduce the toxicity of these treatments and prevent unpleasant side effects. According to engineer Chelsea Chen, the key is electric charge. Chen, who designed the materials for the device, says since certain cancer drugs have a positive charge, she used a negatively charged material in the membrane. "One block is mechanically strong. It keeps the membrane together. It&#x2019;s made of polyethylene. It&#x2019;s just like garbage bags, also made of polyethylene. And the other block is the active block. It&#x2019;s the drug capture block. So it contains sulfonic acid groups, and this group is negatively charged." The device is simply inserted into a vein during a chemotherapy session, then removed afterwards. Chen says the focus is to create a membrane that picks up as much of the drug as quickly as possible, so it doesn&#x2019;t circulate to the rest of the body.</description>

    <description>It looks like you can thank copper for your body&#x2019;s ability to burn fat. According to chemist Chris Chang of the University of California, Berkeley, the metal nutrient acts as what&#x2019;s called a &#x201C;brake on a brake,&#x201D; using a somewhat counterintuitive process to metabolize fat. "There&#x2019;s a process that stops normal fat burning, and what we found was that copper stops or blocks what normally blocks fat burning. And so by blocking the block, then you actually allow fat burning to proceed." Chang found that tissue could not burn fat as well without copper, which you take in normally through your diet. "It&#x2019;s mainly found in green leafy vegetables, different sorts of fruit, nuts, mushrooms, and seafood/shellfish. The biochemical mechanisms that we identified in fat tissue turn out to be conserved in other parts of the body. And so it might have some implications for other diseases or normal behavior and function." Similar interactions with copper are also found in the brain, heart, and pancreas. </description>

    <description>The longer a woman is able to reproduce, before she reaches menopause, the less her risk to have heart failure. That, according to a study by Nisha Parikh, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. &#x201C;This is a very interesting study and a very important study." It is based on medical records of over 160 thousand women gathered by the Women&#x2019;s Health Initiative in the 1990s &#x2013; up until 2014. The initiative was set up to address major heath issues causing morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women. &#x201C;Over the years the Women&#x2019;s Health Initiative has been funded by NIH as well as the national Heart Lung and Blood institute. There was a lack of studies on women&#x2019;s health. And it really represented the first systematic study of women.&#x201D; Parikh is now planning to expand this research and hopes to discover what exactly drives the association between the menstrual cycle and heart disease.</description>

    <description>When we think about our food system, we need to factor in that about 33 percent of the land area is now used for animals for food. And according to Ben Houlton, director of the John Muir Institute of the Environment at the University of California, Davis, that has a huge influence on the global climate cycle. "We have to think about the methane that&#x2019;s being released from animals and rice patties and areas where we&#x2019;re growing food. And we have to consider this nitrous oxide gas that&#x2019;s being produced from the fertilizers we&#x2019;re feeding to the microbes that live in the soil." Nitrous oxide, or N2O, is the third largest contributor to global warming. Houlton and his colleagues identified nitrogen &#x2018;fingerprints&#x2019; in soil samples to trace its journey and model how it moves through ecosystems and escapes into the air or water. Without adding the nitrogen cycle, Houlton says previous climate models were underestimated. "Our discovery helped improve that understanding greatly so that we can now put this into our global models and help policymakers make better informed decisions."</description>

    <description>Seven American cities have approved ballot measures in favor of soda taxes. Public health expert Kris Madsen of the University of California, Berkeley explains how smoking and a subsequent tobacco tax set the precedent for the more recent sugar-sweetened beverage taxes. Transcript: "I think the tax that we saw on tobacco is really similar to the tax that you know supporting for sugar-sweetened beverages. So smoking is a great precedent. And in fact, this is one of the reasons that we think about why sugar-sweetened beverages as opposed to kind of anything that's out there that might fall into a junk food category. What we don't have in the U.S., anymore, and this is good news, we don't have a problem with people needing empty calories. I mean there have been times when hunger has been so severe that it would have been great to feed even empty calories, just calories on the table, right. That's not a problem now. There are still people who are hungry, but the solution is not giving them empty calories. It's getting healthier food into the emergency food system, for example. So tobacco and the taxes on tobacco are a great analogy when we're just talking about something like sugar-sweetened beverages because it's a luxury. It's something that you should - you know the American Heart Association just came out with new recommendations for kids, no more than six teaspoons of added sugar a day, and that kids shouldn't have more than one sugar-sweetened beverage a week, right? That's a huge recommendation and they're acknowledging, look, it's a little bit like a luxury tax on alcohol or cigarettes. That's your choice that's fine, but clearly it should only happen occasionally. " Listen to a related episode: https://soundcloud.com/sciencetoday/soda_public_health</description>

    <description>Children who suffer from emotional or physical abuse are at higher risk of developing health problems, but scientists are unclear about how to reverse these harmful effects. So, this is the focus of a new study by Nicole Bush, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco. "One of our goals was to look across the variety of systems to see for example whether we can improve immune functioning, cortisol stress hormone level, telomere lengths and DNA methylation profiles." Bush hopes to achieve this with psychotherapy, which could be very effective for mental and physical health. And studies have proven just that. "There has been a recent meta-analysis that suggests we can improve children's cortisol functioning through intervention after adversity and we can get them to return to normal levels." And less stress means fewer health problems in the future, including obesity, depression and diabetes, which is widespread among young Americans.</description>

    <description>Does poverty affect children&#x2019;s teeth? A study by the University of California, San Francisco found that low-income patients were at higher risk of developing cavities, than those with means. UCSF School of Dentistry professor Peter Rechmann surveyed patients who receive dental care at California&#x2019;s subsidized clinics. "If you go with me into the clinics, and we take a look and there are 80-something people sitting. You will be frustrated how much cavities you see, how much teeth, which are destroyed right now." But Rechmann says we shouldn&#x2019;t blame income alone for poor dental hygiene. "The income on its own actually doesn&#x2019;t matter at all. It&#x2019;s just if someone suffers to survive, he doesn&#x2019;t have the time to spend x minutes of taking care of their teeth." Rechmann believes instead of drilling, dentists should focus more on preventive care and better educating patients about caries risk. He says more than 30 universities across the United States have joined efforts to follow this path of dental care.</description>

    <description>How do researchers test new glues for fetal surgery? Bioengineer Phillip Messersmith of the University of California, Berkeley is synthesizing bio-inspired glues to seal the delicate amniotic sac during a procedure. The glues are based off an adhesive used by mussels, the hard-shelled mollusks, to stick to wet surfaces. And it takes multiple rounds of testing to make sure such a product does in fact work. "The entry level testing would involve some mimic of a tissue. We could use, for example, and do routinely use, sausage casing, which actually has relatively similar mechanical properties to the fetal membranes." If some of these formulations look promising, the next step is to test them on fetal membrane tissues like discarded placentas from births. "For formulations that work well in that situation, then we can advance to a third stage which would be pre-clinical animal studies." Messersmith and his team are currently working to strengthen their second generation of glues. </description>

    <description>When it comes to dealing with cavities, not all dentists want to get out that formidable drill. Dr. Peter Rechmann of the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry follows a new approach, called Caries Management by Risk Assessment, or CAMBRA. This basically means - fighting cavities before they invade your teeth. &#x201C;You recommend to a patient some behavior change and additional chemical interventions like fluoride, which makes the teeth harder, like chlorhexidine, which kills bacteria." Add to that chewing gum with xylitol and teeth may be saved in the pre-caries stage without dental procedures. &#x201C;I watched under x-rays those lesions where someone would take a drill and drill it, and I saw some of them completely disappearing&#x201D;. Since Rechmann started the caries management program, word of mouth has brought him many new patients for checkups and cleanings, so he calls on his colleagues to consider following his footsteps.</description>

    <description>Immunotherapy can be effective in fighting cancer, but the immune system's killer T-cells sometimes make mistakes and attack normal cells instead. Wendell Lim, a molecular scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, believes he can change this by engineering T-cells. "One of the things that has been a challenge is how we increase the precision of the cell that they are better at recognizing cancer cells and discriminating them from normal cells. We have successfully programmed the T-cells like robots that can search the body and then deliver various payloads there. So it is like a smart weapon for combatting cancer. " In fact, Lim says, in just a couple of years the Food and Drug Administration might approve the engineered cells as a therapy to battle cancer. So, the scientists have geared up and are actively testing the technology now in labs. "I think we can transform what cancer therapy is like. Some of these immune therapies really might give much longer extensions of life."</description>

    <description>In 1989, UC Berkeley psychologist Robert Levenson began to study a group of people who had been married at least 15 years or 35 years, depending on age, to get a better sense of what fairly successful marriages are like. This was not purely a behavioral study, as they also managed to collect genetic samples from many of these 156 couples. In this interview excerpt, Levenson explains the implications for future couples. Robert Levenson: "Well, one of the things that motivated us to do this study is that we felt this might be the last opportunity to study the dinosaurs of marriage. The people who had 50 years with a particular person. And at the time we started in the 80s it looked like the divorce rate was reaching 65 percent in this country. Seven out of 10 marriages ending in divorce. And so here was a group that grew up in a different era and had you know sort of stayed together and we wanted to understand them just in case they disappeared from the earth. Well, I think things are different now and you know we&#x2019;re in this period of flux in marriage. A lot of people don&#x2019;t marry. The divorce rate has gone back down again to 50 percent. I don&#x2019;t know whether the modal marriage for the millennial generation will be, you know, marry once, marry twice, marry three times. But I think the basic biology here, the relationship between behavior and biology doesn&#x2019;t require you to be married. You know this is a statement about what counts in terms of your being happy in a relationship. And although our tools may not be strong enough to detect these in the first and second and third years, I still expect that these genetic influences are having the same effects on relationships today as they did, you know, 20 and 40 years ago in those marriages." Branin/host: "Right and as you say with the dinosaurs, I mean I think that&#x2019;s the joke, you know, people will say about their grandparents - they stuck together even though they didn&#x2019;t seem very happy and yet they did." Robert Levenson: "Now that might happen again. You know we go through these pendular kinds of sociological changes and for a while it seemed like we were in sort of a casual relationship. People lived together, they didn&#x2019;t marry, but who knows what it&#x2019;s going to be like in the future. And who knows probably the best bet is the pendulum will swing back and maybe people will form better marriages and will find ways of making better mate selection. And maybe even genes will play a role in that. And you know you&#x2019;ll go and you&#x2019;ll talk to your grandma and your grandpa and they&#x2019;ll give you advice and then you&#x2019;ll go to your geneticist and she&#x2019;ll give you advice and you&#x2019;ll put that all together in this kind of unique algorithm that will say okay I&#x2019;m going to go this way. And then if you&#x2019;re smart you&#x2019;ll listen. And if you&#x2019;re not you&#x2019;ll say ah, I know best. I&#x2019;m just going to marry whoever I want to. But I don&#x2019;t think human nature is going to get re-writ in any particular, you know, in any short period of time."

    <description>Glaucoma is the world&#x2019;s second-leading cause of blindness, and it affects about 80 million people worldwide and has no cure. But vision scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have discovered molecules that could probably halt the progression of the disease. Gronert: &#x201C;We identified a novel factor, a new factor that potentially protects the optic nerve against damage, which is one of the underlying causes of glaucoma. That&#x2019;s Karsten Gronert, a professor of optometry at UC Berkeley. He says, for decades, academic labs and pharmaceutical companies were trying to find treatment for glaucoma, but couldn&#x2019;t show any promising results. This is probably because they were targeting the disease when it was already too late. "Once you have a degeneration of the optic nerve head, which is what causes glaucoma and eventually leads to blindness, that process is irreversible and cannot be stopped.&#x201D; So Gronert and his colleagues took a different route. Instead of trying to fix what has been permanently damaged, they focused on prevention - protecting the mechanism that stops nerve degeneration.</description>

    <description>How does one make a brain atlas? John Ngai, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley explains. &#x201C;You can think of it as a taxonomy. You might think about what are all the species of birds that there are on Earth, you might think of it as needing to first identify those types.&#x201D; So, just like with a bird encyclopedia, UC Berkeley neurologists are trying to find and organize brain cells into a catalogue of sorts. &#x201C;We know there are many different types of neurons in the brain. They look different. We might have some ideas about how they function differently. But we have no rational way of categorizing them. But using new molecular and genetic techniques, we have a very powerful way of classifying them.&#x201D; The brain atlas is an ambitious multimillion-dollar project that will help researchers better understand how brain cells wire up and function. And that could be the key to cure of neurological diseases, including autism and Alzheimer&#x2019;s. For Science Today, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin.</description>

    <description>Precision medicine should change the way researchers conduct experimental studies. That&#x2019;s according to pediatric surgeon Hanmin Lee of the University of California, San Francisco. &#x201C;All the studies that are currently done right now and all the data that is collected is generally on one subset of patients which is generally older white men. But for let&#x2019;s say young under-represented female minority patients, the implication of this manifestation, this disease, might be far different.&#x201C; So, Lee says scientists should make studies more inclusive. &#x201C;And we can only get to that if we look at large data sets as opposed to what we&#x2019;ve done historically in the past, which is looking at a 100 or 200 patients in a trial.&#x201D; Lee hopes the era of electronic medical records will give researchers and doctors access to a large volume of reliable data, which will help make studies and medicine more precise.</description>

    <description>This is Science Today. Every year, about 250 thousand women in America are diagnosed with breast cancer, making it one of the leading types of cancers nationwide. And now a University of California, San Francisco study reveals a major risk factor of the disease. Study leader Karla Kerlikowske says it&#x2019;s breast structure, or as researchers says, breast density. &#x201C;Breast density is a radiologic term. On a mammogram, you look at how much in quotes &#x201C;dense&#x201D; tissue someone has vs how much fat." Kerlikowske&#x2019;s team evaluated over 200,000 women and discovered that breast density by far exceeds other risk factors. &#x201C;People commonly think if you have a family history of breast cancer that contributes mostly to women developing breast cancer, but we found breast density was 4 times more likely to account for the development of breast cancer than having a first degree relative who had breast cancer." Kerlikowske says women in this risk group should pay extra attention to screening tests.</description>

    <description>Oxytocin is most commonly called the &#x201C;love&#x201D; hormone, but it has also been referred to as the "mama bear" hormone. Jennifer Mitchel, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, describes why. &#x201C;I love my baby, I love my baby so much, that if you get anywhere close to my baby, I will rip you to shreds. So when we administer oxytocin to our populations, we are trying to keep these darker behaviors in mind as well." In a new study Mitchell is also testing oxytocin as a therapy for military personnel who suffer from PTSD and alcohol abuse. She says it is an effective way to keep stress and anxiety in check. "Oxytocin can make one feel more pair-bonded, it is important for maternal attachment, for breastfeeding, for child birth, perhaps falling in love or those feelings associated with falling in love, but it also contributes to sort of non-group behavior. Believing there is an enemy or feeling that you have to protect yourself against others." But so far - Mitchell says - she hasn&#x2019;t seen any signs of "mama bear"- type behavior in her study group.</description>

    <description>The mental health of aging adults seems to consistently improve with age. But in the same study of adults ages 21 to 100, researchers discovered that those in their 20s and 30s had far worse levels of psychological well-being than any other period of adulthood. "I must say, I was actually surprised in our study by this very high level of stress and depression and anxiety that we found in the younger age groups." That&#x2019;s study leader Dilip Jeste of the University of California, San Diego. He explains that there have been other studies reporting that in one&#x2019;s twenties, there&#x2019;s a high level of well-being that slowly comes down towards mid-life and then it starts to improve again. "My personal feeling is that adolescence is a difficult period of life, so how is it possible that suddenly in the twenties you would have the best wellbeing level? That&#x2019;s not possible. So, I do believe that our findings are more consistent with what is happening, at least now." Jeste adds that their findings suggest more attention should be paid to the mental health of younger adults.</description>

    <description>In the last couple of years, researchers have come a long way in their understanding of the genetic risk factors for autism &#x2013; from not knowing how to find autism genes to discovering a variety of mutations linked to the disorder. Psychiatrist Stephen Sanders and his colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco recently found a molecule responsible for infantile autism. &#x201C;The hope is that this gene gives us insight of what autism is at a fundamental new logical level. So key things we want to find out are &#x2013; is there an age at which we could fix this gene problem and see if the problem can go away? Or we have to do it early on?&#x201D; Basically, the discovery gives scientists hope that autism could possibly be cured not only in children, but in adults, too. &#x201C;We also want to see where in the brain and when in the brain which cell types are involved to try to work out what autism is and see if this underlying defect can be repaired or at least changed in an adult.&#x201C;</description>

    <description>There was a lot of exciting University of California research news this past week. First the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug that could halt Multiple Sclerosis. We had previously spoken to neurologist Bruce Cree of the University of California, San Francisco about his work testing the new drug, called ocrelizumab. At the time, Cree explained that it actually targets B-cells in the human body, blocking the inflammation that drives the disease. He explained that most MS therapies in the past targeted T-cells, which often had serious side effects. "You can have profound immunological effects and clinical benefits by just targeting B-cells alone. And I think this is actually an important advance for multiple sclerosis because when you just target B-cells without affecting T-cells, you have less of a potential for adverse events due to broad spectrum immune suppression." Really, such great news considering this devastating disease affects hundreds of thousands of Americans and more than 2.3 million people worldwide. While at UCSF we visited neurologist Lauren Weiss, who has discovered a new way to study brain disorders. Basically, they are growing brain cells out of simple skin biopsies taken from patients with autism and other developmental problems. "We can grow those cells in a lab and then turn them into stem cells and ultimately in the cells of the brain. That&#x2019;s a pretty amazing advance when you think about how challenging it is to study the human brain. Nobody wants to give you too much access to that!"

    <description>Parents, the next time your child picks up a can of soda, tell them they're at risk of shortening their telomeres. These are the protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes and they affect how quickly our cells age. And when our telomeres are shortened, this puts us at risk of age-related maladies like heart disease, diabetes, and some types of cancer. Dr. Cindy Leung of the University of California, San Francisco, says that while their study surveyed healthy adults, it's also possible that soda consumption is associated with telomere shortening in kids. "We know that childhood is a really critical window for our telomeres to develop. If we're marketing sugary beverages to children and they're drinking them at such high levels, it could really put them on this accelerated aging trajectory before they even hit adolescence." The good news - Leung says that telomere shortening is reversible. "Drinking less sugary beverages would be one way to either halt or slow down their telomere shortening process. We should promote other health behaviors that would help to lengthen our telomeres." </description>

    <description>What can tarantulas teach us about human pain, other than an unpleasant lesson? Researcher Jeremiah Osteen of the University of California, San Francisco discovered two toxins in tarantula venom that are surprisingly selective in the ways they trigger the sensation of pain. This suggests new avenues of research and possible drug treatments. "We look into the venom of the spider and find toxins that will activate certain pain pathways. That gives us a better sense of how those pain pathways work in other contexts, like when you cut yourself or fall down. And so what the toxins have given us the ability to do is to look very specifically at this particular type of pain pathway, to have a better understanding of what types of neurons are involved, what types of molecules are involved, in order to design better pain drugs." And these pathways have also been linked to certain neurological disorders, like epilepsy and Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease .</description>

    <description>A recent UCLA study has found that diet and exercise can reduce protein build-ups linked to Alzheimer's disease in those who have subtle memory loss, but have yet been diagnosed with dementia. "The data that lifestyle, that diet and exercise can impact cognition relatively quickly, that's pretty new data. A few years ago, nobody ever thought that you could measure a change with just an exercise intervention, so there are some big advances being made." That's Alzheimer's disease researcher Karen Gylys of the UCLA School of Nursing. We interviewed Gylys recently about her own novel work looking at Alzheimer's disease progression in the synapses, where the brain cells transmit impulses. At the time, she explained how complicated Alzheimer's is and how it will take more than just one solution to stave it off, but she was bolstered by findings that exercise and a Mediterranean-rich diet were linked to lower levels of plaques in brain scans. "Understanding the power of these lifestyle interventions makes me optimistic."</description>

    <description>HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, is often referred to as the &#x2018;good cholesterol&#x2019;. That&#x2019;s because HDL particles remove cholesterol out of our cells and out of our bodies. But a University of California, Davis study has found there&#x2019;s more to HDLs than that. Angela Zivkovic, an assistant professor of nutrition, explains. "They don&#x2019;t just suck cholesterol out. They also actually interact with your immune cells and do some really interesting things to modify the way that your immune system is responding to different things. So, it looks like they can really be remodeled." Zivkovic found that the composition of HDLs, particularly the amount and structure of sugars called glycans, varies in individuals. And this can cause different functions, including influencing the body&#x2019;s inflammatory response. "It&#x2019;s not really been understood how exactly that happens, and so what we&#x2019;re really interested in is, how can you change the composition of the HDL particles to get them to be more anti-inflammatory?" The hope is, HDL sugars can be tested to better predict one&#x2019;s susceptibility to disease.</description>

    <description>Virtual reality may help people with a visual condition called amblyopia, in which there is reduced vision in one eye. Neuroscientist Adrian Chopin of the University of California, Berkeley, says they&#x2019;re treating patients with this visual defect by having them play 3D computer games that, he says, could restore their eyesight. &#x201C;Virtual reality is really developing tremendously right now. We are trying to develop a new game. That is something in between a video game industry and treatment.&#x201D; Chopin hopes this new 3D computer game treatment will overwrite the old dogma that adult patients&#x2019; amblyopia cannot be cured. &#x201C;Now we have all these optometrists and ophthalmologists out there telling the patients very often that there is nothing that can be done for them because they are too old and they needed to be treated when they were children. And we realize it is not true. I mean, it is difficult to change it, but it is not that it is impossible." Chopin says the virtual reality study is already showing signs of success with some patients&#x2019; eyesight significantly improving.</description>

    <description>If you could do something to avoid facing the dental drill, wouldn&#x2019;t you do it? This week on Science Today, we chatted with Dr. Peter Rechmann of the UC San Francisco School of Dentistry about a new approach they&#x2019;re using there called Caries Management by Risk Assessment, or CAMBRA. Basically, it means fighting cavities before they invade your teeth. "You recommend to a patient some behavior change and additional chemical interventions like fluoride, which makes the teeth harder, like chlorhexidine, which kills bacteria." Rechmann says adding chewing gum with xylitol can also save teeth in the pre-cavity stage. He&#x2019;s even seen lesions in x-rays that would have otherwise called for the drill, completely disappear. So next time, you may want to think twice before passing up an offer for gum..just make sure it&#x2019;s a brand with xylitol. Next, we visit UC Berkeley, where we learned how researchers there are designing a water filter made of a material so thin, it&#x2019;s 2-dimensional. Baoxia Mi says they make these membrane filters by organizing the nanomaterial graphene oxide into single layers of carbon, and then stacking them together. "This material has a lot of properties that are suitable for membrane filtration, especially for water purification &#x2013; disinfection, absorption, or some other properties, that can help us enhance the removal of water contaminants." Unlike current membrane filters, Mi&#x2019;s design does not require as much energy to push the water through the membrane, since water passes quickly across graphene. Really, there&#x2019;s so much exciting research like this going on like the University of California, so please come back for more.

    <description>Researchers have discovered a new way to spot brain injuries that arise after a concussion. With advanced, functional MRI scanners, doctors can not only make images of what the brain looks like after the injury, but also how it works. &#x201C;To get a better handle of being able to say what&#x2019;s going wrong in the brain after the concussions, we are actually looking at brain function and connectivity in the brain, how different brain regions connect with each other and talk to each other.&#x201D; Pratik Mukherjee, a professor of radiology at the University of California, San Francisco adds that the new technology allows scientists to see what traditional MRI tests failed to detect. &#x201C;The typical MRI scan that people get at a hospital or in outpatient clinics are not useful for concussions because they just look at the anatomy of the brain and most people with concussions don&#x2019;t have big problems anatomically. Few might have tiny little bleeds in the brain, but even that is a minority.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>It&#x2019;s a New Year and that means, lots of new stories are in the hopper! First up, do you have trouble sleeping at night? And if you do, how many of you spend time propped up on your pillows, scrolling through your smartphone or tablets before getting some sleep? Our guess is, probably many of you do this, as it turns out 70% of Americans keep their phones on their bedside table. We spoke to cardiologist Gregory Marcus of the UC San Francisco about this. In case you&#x2019;re wondering why a cardiologist is talking about sleep, he explains that a lack of Zzz&#x2019;s can cause high blood pressure, heart attacks, arrhythmia and strokes. "Poor sleep quality is not simply an issue of feeling tired the next day, we recognize now that sleep is extremely important to mood, to brain function, cognition." Marcus adds that he&#x2019;s not trying to demonize technology. Instead, he suggests vigilance and putting the phone away at least an hour before sleep. Give it a try. Meanwhile, at UC Berkeley, researchers took a cue from nature to create Salto. Roboticist Duncan Haldane says Salto can jump higher and faster than any other robot out there. "Salto is inspired by a galago, which is a bushbaby. Biologists have found animals adapted specifically for jumping had this kind of super crouch posture. The longer they stay in a crouch, the more energy they can transfer into the tendons and the more energy they can return for jumping." The team is hoping Salto&#x2019;s novel locomotive abilities can be used in search and rescue efforts. And finally, we meet UCLA neuroscientist Adriana Galv&#xE1;n to discuss the adolescent brain. You may have thought people become adults at 18, but from a neuroscience perspective, the brain keeps growing and developing beyond that age and current literature suggests that it&#x2019;s around age 25 that the brain finishes the period of adolescence. "The majority of what we call &#x2018;plasticity&#x2019; or sensitivity to the environment changes around the mid-twenties and so that means that although the brain can keep changing in response to new experiences or learning something new, the majority of that development has ended."

    <description>Climate change models include many complex factors, from the Earth&#x2019;s natural cycles to wind patterns. Even clouds must be considered when forecasting things like weather and temperature. At the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, physical chemist Kevin Wilson found a way to better predict the size of cloud droplets, which form on aerosolized particles like salt from sea spray. Wilson says the next step is to simplify their findings for these climate change models. "We&#x2019;ve studied this cloud droplet formation in our laboratory under very controlled conditions, and so the kinds of models we&#x2019;ve developed are much too complicated to actually implement in climate models. And so one next step is to be able to distill all of the molecular information to more simple parameterizations that accurately reflect the underlying physics and chemistry, but could be used in the climate model in a computationally efficient way. It&#x2019;s trying to bridge the gap between simple laboratory experiments and the real complexity of the atmosphere." </description>

    <description>When it comes to composting, there are different phases. There is pre-consumer waste, like scraps from prepping food, and then there&#x2019;s post-consumer waste, or table scrap refuse, which needs to be separated from the other trash. Jill Horst, director of dining services at the University of California, Santa Barbara, says composting on their campus has evolved over the years. "We started small and we just did pre-consumer waste to compost and we really wanted to do post-consumer because we were trying to divert as much as possible from the landfill." By partnering with a local company, Horst says the campus now has a compost compactor to scrap everything in the dining hall. "So right now, we divert 90 percent of our waste from the landfill, so 90 percent of our waste is going to this composting company up that street. It is huge." And it&#x2019;s in keeping with the University of California&#x2019;s efforts to be carbon neutral by 2025.</description>

    <description>Nanocrystalline metals and alloys have been the subject of considerable research in recent years because of advances in computational materials science and the fact it&#x2019;s properties can create lighter and stronger metals for automobiles. Materials scientist and mechanical engineer Suveen Mathaudhu of the University of California, Riverside, says nanocrystalline metals can be used beyond automotive and transportation applications. "Nanocrystalline metals can be used for a variety of different applications, including things like biomedical implants. If we can make things like stents and facial implants out of lightweight materials like magnesium, the magnesium will also dissolve in the body over time and the implant may not have to be removed." It can also be used for electrical conduction. "To be able to design wires and cables that can conduct energy in more efficient ways. There&#x2019;s quite a variety of things that can be done using nanostructured metals and alloys that will open up once these materials are mature enough."</description>

    <description>Why are the majority of male infertility cases a mystery? While 80% of female infertility cases can be diagnosed and dealt with, the same percentage of male infertility cases are untreatable. Biologist Polina Lishko of the University of California, Berkeley says the key might be at the molecular level of the sperm. In a recent project, Lishko documented the proteins in a human sperm cell hoping to provide a starting point for research in this field. "The current situation with male fertility is quite dramatic. And part of the reason why we are so low on our good diagnostics of male infertility is that we don&#x2019;t know what makes the human sperm cell fertile. So that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s absolutely important to understand what&#x2019;s going on, how they work, then we can help to design better diagnostics, and we can help infertile couples boost sperm fertility, if you understand why they&#x2019;re infertile." By unraveling the molecular nuances of fertilization, Lishko hopes researchers can finally explain the technicalities of human reproduction. </description>

    <description>Time to catch up on Science Today stories. First up, environmental scientists are starting to use drone technology to monitor how forests are affected by droughts, particularly those that have been affecting the Golden State&#x2019;s iconic sequoia trees. Molecular biologist Todd Dawson of UC Berkeley says with drones, researchers can get a more refined picture in areas where there has been a lot of tree mortality. That&#x2019;s because in a matter of minutes, drones can allow researchers to survey canopies of individual trees and entire forests. "That means we are basically keeping our finger on the pulse of the forest change, which we have never been able to do with any of our other tools before." Next, if you have some pain relievers in your medicine cabinet, you may want to take a closer look at the back of the bottle. The FDA has been putting bigger warning labels on pain relievers like ibuprofen and other drugs known as NSAIDs because of their known risk to increase heart disease and stroke. Researcher Aldrin Gomes of UC Davis, who found that NSAIDs can cause cardiac cells to die after prolonged use, says he&#x2019;s particularly interested in educating certain age groups about this. "Between 45 and 65, your risk of stroke from natural causes increases. And above 65, it increases even further. And when you add NSAIDs to this at these different age groups, it further increases your risk." So if you&#x2019;re in this age group, try not to use NSAIDs on a regular basis. And finally, if your mind started to wander during this update, I won&#x2019;t get offended; that&#x2019;s because UC Santa Barbara&#x2019;s Jonathan Schooler, a professor of psychological and brain sciences, told us that there&#x2019;s some cognitive value to daydreaming. He conducted a study looking specifically at creative scientists and creative writers to see when they have innovative ideas. "What we found is that in both of these groups, about a third of their ideas happened while they&#x2019;re mind wandering; we also find that the ideas that they have when they&#x2019;re mind wandering are more likely to be an &#x2018;ah-ha!&#x2019; kind of solution. Something where they really were not expecting it and more likely to involve overcoming an impasse." So if you&#x2019;re not really tuning in to this right now, let&#x2019;s hope it&#x2019;s because you just had an &#x2018;ah-ha!&#x2019; moment.

    <description>Researchers are striving to unveil the secrets about &#x201C;dark&#x201D; DNA, part of the genome that does not code proteins, but plays an important role in regulating genes. Scientist Diane Dickel of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been working on finding all of these non-coding regulators -so called enhancers - and pinning them on a map. &#x201C;I mean, it is like building a road map and adding information onto that, to point that particular pairs in the genome act as these enhancer elements to regulate gene expression.&#x201D; This map will help researchers get a better picture of the dark DNA, which could shed a light on whether mutations in the enhancers cause genetic diseases. Dickel says this would also be the next step towards improving genetic testing. &#x201C;The hope of genetic testing is to try to understand biology of what&#x2019;s happening in the cell to develop treatments for that longer term." And, give patients clear answers about their health and genetic predispositions. For Science Today, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin.</description>

    <description>Many of us might assume a drug is safe if it&#x2019;s available over-the-counter, but that&#x2019;s not always the case. Biochemist Aldrin Gomes of the University of California, Davis studies NSAIDs, a category of drugs that includes familiar anti-inflammatories like Ibuprofen. Up to 20% of the population use these pain relievers at any given time, but their chronic use may be harsher on the body than expected. "Most people are not aware that NSAIDs have a known history of causing heart problems. NSAIDs actually increase the risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease. So we first did a screen of different NSAIDs to see if any of them would affect cardiac cells. And to our surprise, all the NSAIDs we tested affected the heart cells." Some of the NSAIDs had a profound effect, causing rapid cardiac cell death. But now, Gomes hopes to study the side effects of other NSAIDs and see if certain protective factors, like antioxidants, can relieve them. </description>

    <description>Nearly 40 percent of worldwide agricultural crops are destroyed by insects. Take the small invasive fruit fly known as the spotted wing Drosophila. It feeds on ripening fruits, laying eggs inside berries, causing hundreds of millions of dollars&#x2019; worth of agricultural damage. Entomologist Anandasankar Ray of the University of California, Riverside says most flies go for rotting fruits that have fallen off plants. "But these flies will go after the ripening fruit. And so this is of particular concern because when you have fruit or produce that is close to harvest, you really do not want to spray toxic chemical on them." Ray helped identify a safe repellent that uses a grape-smelling chemical compound that&#x2019;s produced naturally in fruits in small amounts. In the lab, ripe blueberries coated with it warded off the hungry flies. "We will continually improve upon these active ingredients that we found. It&#x2019;s not a stagnant process, it is technology-driven and innovation-driven." </description>

    <description>Studies show that about 10 percent of Americans are diagnosed with asthma each year. Susan Lynch, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Francisco studied the microbiome to hone in on why asthma and allergies are so widespread in Western nations. "Some of the risk factors for allergic asthma include very early life exposure such as a lack of the mother's exposure to livestock or furred pets while she is pregnant, formula feeding, Cesarean section delivery and antibiotic use during pregnancy or very early life of post natal period. And so those risk factors suggest that these factors may influence the microbes in the community of microbes that exist in humans and particularly in very early life." Knowing this, Lynch says to prevent these immune diseases, scientists and parents should focus on changing children's microbiological development very early in life.</description>

    <description>Infertility could be linked to heart problems. That&#x2019;s according to Nisha Parikh, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. In a new study, the researcher is trying to find out how pregnancy loss, which is sometimes related to infertility, is connected to heart disease. &#x201C;There has been several studies that shown a link between pregnancy loss, including miscarriage and stillbirth with cardiovascular disease in the future. And we are very interested in our laboratory in studying the mechanisms that underlie this association. &#x201D; Parikh says, it also might be a good idea for women and their doctors to follow these guidelines during medial check-ups. &#x201C;When practitioners, and by that I mean your primary care doctor or somebody&#x2019;s cardiologist has a woman in their office and they are trying to figure out what their risk for developing heart disease and heart failure is, than reproductive factors and pregnancy factors are important to ask&#x201D;.</description>

    <description>A new supercomputer simulation is helping scientists visualize the evolution of stars. The NASA-funded project is based on code written by astrophysicist Richard Klein of the University of California, Berkeley and the Lawrence Livermore National Lab. According to Klein, this simulation is one step towards a comprehensive theory of star formation, which begins when a cloud of interstellar gas collapses under gravity. "So we start with these turbulent magnetized clouds. Follow the cloud for up to a million years of evolution, all the way to the point where stars can form in clusters." Klein turns to observations of real stars to check the results. "We begin to calculate what the properties of those stellar clusters are in great detail and then compare the properties that we get from the large scale simulations with what the observations are actually telling us." The team is currently working towards even larger-scale simulations. </description>

    <description>If you often snack throughout the day, your teeth are at risk. That&#x2019;s according to Peter Rechmann, a professor of dentistry at the University of California, San Francisco. In his recent study called Caries Management by Risk Assessment, Rechmann has shed light on how to save your teeth before caries ruins them. So for those who like to graze during the day, Rechman says one tip to prevent cavities is to eat fast. &#x201C;We kept on telling our patients - you can have chocolate, no problem, eat the whole thing in 10 minutes and brush your teeth or use chewing gums, but don&#x2019;t eat the chocolate over, piece by piece, every 10 minutes a piece. That is terrible.&#x201D; Savoring like this leaves more sugar for bacteria in your mouth. And types of snack also matter for your dental hygiene. So, try cutting down on carbohydrates. &#x201C;I even suggest not to snack at all on carbohydrates. So if you do more than three times, your caries risk really, really goes up.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Diagnosing brain disorders can often be a challenge for doctors, as some psychological diseases have overlapping symptoms. These include memory loss in patients with depression and suppressed mood in people suffering from dementia. But neuroimaging and machine learning can help improve diagnosis. In fact, radiologist Cyrus Raji of the University of California, San Francisco, led a study to prove just that. &#x201C;Each individual had a perfusion neuroimaging, where there is a nuclear tracer injected into them and that allowed the mapping of the blood flow in the brain. And that allow us to quantify blood flow in 128 regions of the brain and use machine learning analysis to separate who had depression or cognitive disorders or both." Machine learning is used often to quickly process and analyze patients&#x2019; data in digital format. &#x201C;What machine learning will do in the future for research is it will help us find new biomarkers that are helpful in predicting either who has a disorder or who has one disorder vs another that we are trying to separate from each other.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today, we covered a lot of topics, including a new finding sheds light on the unknown parts of the genome. This has often been called &#x2018;junk DNA&#x2019;, but scientist Diane Dickel of the Berkeley Lab doesn&#x2019;t like that term. Instead, she says these are non-coding parts of the genome. "Only about 3 percent of the genome consists of genes, the other, more than 95 percent of the genome, what we call non-coding, which just means that it does not encode genes. And it is clear these are important things in that non-coding sequence." It is mutations in these non-encoding sequences, called enhancers, that causes genetic diseases. And this is an important finding because doctors don&#x2019;t know what triggers some of these diseases, including cardiomyopathy &#x2013; that&#x2019;s a genetic heart disease. And that&#x2019;s because researchers were looking for clues in the wrong part of the genome. Meanwhile, at UC San Diego, researchers looking into the mental health of seniors made a startling discovery about young adults. Dilip Jeste explains that there&#x2019;s long been an assumption that the mental health of older people mirrors their declining physical and cognitive function &#x2013; but that&#x2019;s not the case. They seem to do better with age, despite physical ailments. It&#x2019;s those in their 20s and 30s who have very high levels of depression and anxiety. So Jeste suggests people do more studies looking into the value of intergenerational activities. "I think we need larger scale, better studies in which you can have younger people having an older person and they become partners or a team with mentorship in both directions." So, a younger person can teach seniors about, technology for instance; and older folks can pass along pearls of wisdom about certain aspects of life. The main goal would be to promote mental health in all age groups. And in a similar vein, UC Santa Barbara has a new Center for Mindfulness and Human Potential. We spoke to co-director Jonathan Schooler about how in the last decade, mindfulness has been picking up steam as a topic of scientific research. "Ten to 15 years ago, it would have been considered almost a taboo topic, like not really science. Almost more in the realm of spirituality or something. But now, the mound of research showing the value of mindfulness has just become demonstrated so many times, in so many contexts."

    <description>This week on Science Today, we learned how a pediatric surgeon is helping to kick-start innovative projects to bring to clinics in an effort to advance children&#x2019;s health. Dr. Hanmin Lee of UC San Francisco, says even though technology, biology and medicine go hand-in-hand, advanced devices are not always available to the most vulnerable hospital patients because of insufficient funding. "We organize the engineering of children&#x2019;s health symposiums to try to bring all the emerging technologies to the benefit of children&#x2019;s health." UCSF is involved in developing many such emerging technologies, including different types of monitoring sensors, artificial organs, and little robots - all to help children with a variety of disabilities for their benefit. And when it comes to vaccinations for kids, we spoke to a UC Berkeley&#x2019;s Dorian Liepmann about their new pill-sized technology that could lead to painless oral vaccines. "One of my co-investigators suggested that we could actually put this in a lollipop for children. And so they would just hold it in their mouth until the drug was delivered and then they&#x2019;d have the rest of the lollipop." While their needleless technology is still proof of concept, Liepmann says some of the advantages &#x2013; besides no more needle! &#x2013; would be that you wouldn&#x2019;t need to pay trained personnel to administer the shot, which is a huge expense. And an easy and effective vaccine like this could lead to better distribution to Third World countries or to rural areas. Liepmann says their technology still needs to undergo clinical trial, so it could be another 5 to 10 years before it&#x2019;s available, but it sure sounds promising to us!

    <description>How do researchers study the transient phenomenon of a cloud? In a recent experiment, physical chemist Kevin Wilson of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used a kind of chamber to simulate cloud conditions in nature, which meant that cloud droplets could form on aerosolized particles. "We have an instrument in our lab that creates the atmospheric conditions that a cloud would form. And so the experiments are rather straightforward. With the right amount of relative humidity or water vapor in the gas phase and the right temperature, we just put in a known size of aerosol and then we measure the droplet that&#x2019;s formed on the other end of this instrument." Wilson and his team used different types of particles, from simple salts to complex mixtures of molecules, to see if they could predict the size of the resulting droplets. "We were absolutely thrilled to be able to, from a physical chemistry perspective and a surface chemistry perspective, provide some insight into a process that is quite important for understanding cloud droplet formation and climate change in particular." </description>

    <description>When you hear the word &#x2018;radioactivity&#x2019;, what do you think of? It might bring to mind nuclear disasters like Fukushima and Chernobyl. But it does exist naturally in our environment. So, physicist Kai Vetter of the University of California, Berkeley wants to change the way we think about radiation. "We have established what we call the Berkeley DoseNet program, aiming at providing simple radiation sensors to communities and to high schools, to enable the broader public to learn about the world we&#x2019;re living in." And speaking of radiation, astronomer Imke de Pater of UC Berkeley has released the most detailed radio maps yet of Jupiter&#x2019;s surface. "We could see just all kinds of different features. For example, the Great Red Spot, and other little ovals and storm systems on Jupiter." The maps are just in time for the arrival of NASA&#x2019;s Juno space probe, which has begun its trip around the gas planet. Meanwhile, back here on terra firma, we meet the Livermore Lab&#x2019;s Jonathan Allen &#x2013; a bioinformatics scientist who has been tapped to join a national panel to study the relationship between &#x2018;built environments&#x2019; and the microbiome. "So, everywhere we go, our skin is contacting surfaces and shedding bacteria on building surfaces and then also it&#x2019;s coming from the natural environment, plants and the outdoor environment."

    <description>Compared to the rest of the body, the brain has higher levels of mineral nutrients like copper, zinc, and iron. This observation led chemist Chris Chang of the University of California, Berkeley to probe down to the level of the neurons, where he found copper was mediating conversations between cells. "So we ended up studying the interface between metals and neuroscience for a while, and the thing that we ended up finding was that copper is important for having brain cells communicate with each other normally." Chang discovered that copper can essentially turn off signals between cells. "The idea is that when two brain cells talk to each other and store and transfer information, there&#x2019;s a movement of copper that occurs between the cells. And so if two cells talk to each other, the copper moves to tell the cells that the signal now can be sort of turned off. So you&#x2019;re almost, like telling them to hang up the telephone." This was the first study directly observing the communication role of copper in the brain. </description>

    <description>A team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley are bioinspired &#x2013; that is, they&#x2019;re finding inspiration from nature and biology to create synthetic materials for a range of problems. Bioengineer Phil Messersmith says while there&#x2019;s particular interest in the medical field, it&#x2019;s not exclusive. In fact, their work creating super-strong mollusk-inspired adhesives for fetal surgery, is also of interest to a group of battery technology scientists at the Berkeley Lab. "For lithium ion batteries, they need better binders for the particles &#x2013; there&#x2019;s huge swelling/de-swelling that happens when you charge and discharge one of these batteries and you have to have effective adhesion between the binder and these particles, otherwise they form cracks and the electrical pathway is interrupted. So, some of the adhesion from our mussel research can be implemented into this battery technology, so we&#x2019;re doing that as well." </description>

    <description>New ways of studying stem cells allow scientists to better understand how they turn into other types of cells. Neuroscientist John Ngai at the University of California, Berkeley, has discovered a revolutionary method to look at stem cells. He explains that studying these in the past was limited to looking at the entire population of cells at once. &#x201C;My analogy would be if you come to Memorial Stadium on a big game day and you want to get an idea of how many Stanford fans there are and how many Cal fans there are and where they are sitting. The old way would only allow us to look at the entire stadium and to get an average of red hats and blue hats, and you might get an idea of what fraction of people are wearing read versus blue, but you wouldn&#x2019;t have a precise definition of numbers, locations or anything like that. So the revolution for us has been the ability to interrogate what genes are being expressed not in the entire tissue but on a cell-by-cell basis.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>When it comes to research on the Zika virus, how well can a brain grown in a laboratory represent the real thing? In his recent studies, neuroscientist Arnold Kriegstein of the University of California, San Francisco realized that laboratories needed a model system to emulate the developing brain. These artificial models, or organoids, had to express a receptor known as A-X-L, which allows Zika to enter a baby&#x2019;s brain from the blood. "We were looking at what other model systems could be used to study how the Zika virus infects cells and we found that those organoids also express AXL, and in the exact same place as they do in the normally developing brain." Although the model has some limitations, it is able to reproduce much of the physiology involved in Zika infection. The cells in these organoids can essentially self-organize into a 3-dimensional structure. "So that encouraged us that this model, which people all over the world are now using, can be studied to understand more about how the virus enters the cell, the consequences of infection, and so on." </description>

    <description>Now that recreational marijuana has been legalized in California and a handful of other states, public health experts are raising concerns over its advertising and distribution. "You are going to see the rise of mass marketing, branding in order to maximize sales and revenue." That&#x2019;s Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Glantz explains that over the years, tobacco companies used additives and chemicals to create a highly addictive product. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve only seen a little bit of that in the marijuana market. We haven&#x2019;t yet seen the kind of high tech product engineering designed to maximize use. Because the distributors &#x2013; mom and pop marijuana market that we have just haven&#x2019;t had technological capability to do what the big corporations could do once they take control of this market." Glantz recommends policymakers shape marijuana laws that would minimize consumption.</description>

    <description>When it comes to getting the message out about climate change, it&#x2019;s one thing to get political leaders onboard, but you also need public support. In fact, atmospheric scientist Veerabadhran Ramanathan of the University of California, San Diego&#x2019;s Scripps Institution of Oceanography says he&#x2019;s hoping for &#x2018;climate warriors&#x2019;. "These are not just flag bearing, which is important, but people who can roll up their sleeves and try to solve the problem. So, I&#x2019;m on my own pathway to create those million climate warriors in the UC system." Ramanathan has teamed up with 50 systemwide academics in disciplines like engineering, technology, social science and humanities &#x2013; to propose a hybrid course taught by about 20 faculty that combines videotaped lectures in a classroom devoted to discussing solutions. The goal would be to pilot it first on nine UC campuses, and then expand the coursework to other colleges. "We are thinking of &#x2018;cradle to grave&#x2019; approach; getting people to understand the scientific method and the need to protect nature."</description>

    <description>A synapse is the point of communication between two neurons and researchers can actually study them in great detail. "It turns out that we can isolate synapses. They&#x2019;re about a micron and they reseal themselves into little circles, into little spheres that we can study biochemically." That&#x2019;s Karen Gylys, a professor at the UCLA School of Nursing, who has been studying Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease using cryopreserved tissue. "It&#x2019;s cryopreserved so that we can get these little spherical, they&#x2019;re called &#x2018;synaptosomes&#x2019;. And so that gives us this ability to sort of see into the synapse &#x2013; to study what&#x2019;s happening. We actually purify thousands and thousands of synapses." Gylys explains that they do this by using a laser-based technology called flow cytometry, which suspends cells in a stream of fluid and passes them one at a time, through an electronic detection apparatus. "In addition to having the cryopreserved tissue that makes the synaptosomes by use of flow cytometry, we can ask the questions we want to ask with very great precision." </description>

    <description>A team of computer scientists and engineers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have developed a software-based tool called Network Mapping System, or NeMS, which improves network security. As computer scientist Domingo Colon explains, one of the limitations on current products is that they&#x2019;re based on configuration. "So, they want to validate that your configuration is as you think it is. And that&#x2019;s fine &#x2013; but what we found is that how something is configured is not necessarily the same thing as how it&#x2019;s used. Meaning, you might have configured it within a given intent, but someone might be using it for a different type of intent." And it&#x2019;s not often nefarious. For instance, people may add products or devices to their computer that they think will be helpful to them. What NeMs does is allow network administrators and security personnel to keep a constant assessment of what that environment looks like. "It provides them a pretty immediate feedback to figure out who&#x2019;s doing what and is this a problem. Sometimes you need that immediacy and to determine from that information is it something that you need to take action on."</description>

    <description>Researchers may have underestimated the amount of methane emitted into the atmosphere in certain parts of the country. That&#x2019;s according to physicist Marc Fisher of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. &#x201C;We conducted a study of methane emissions from San Francisco Bay Area and we found that emissions are roughly one and a half to two times the emissions expected based on inventory estimates, counting how many landfills, how many cows, how many wastewater treatment plants, how many different things that might emit methane.&#x201D; So what does this discovery mean for us? &#x201C;From a human health perspective methane itself is not a hazard unless it reaches such high levels that it combusts, but it is a very potent greenhouse gas." And this requires better management of the pollutant sources, like landfills, to reduce its contribution to climate change.</description>

    <description>Historically, neuroscientists have been mainly focused on excitatory neurons, which stimulate our brain and have paid less attention to the calming, inhibitory neurons. According to Mercedes Paredes, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, it turns out that these inhibitory neurons play a more important role than previously thought. "They make a lot more of synaptic connections with other neurons and play a role not just in maintaining the balance and the activity, but also in the potential for the brain to be flexible." Paredes has discovered that inhibitory neurons, also called interneurons, continue shaping our brain long after we are born, making the brain extremely vulnerable in the first couple of months to a year of our lives. "Inhibitory neurons are the main regulators of the balance between excitation and inhibition in the cortex. When there is damage to interneurons, balance is at risk and it can lead to disorders all the way from epilepsy to potentially neuropsychiatric disorders."</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. The liver is a resilient organ with the magical ability to regenerate itself, but when it&#x2019;s damaged by liver cirrhosis, it can be pushed past the point of no return. Researcher Milad Rezvani of the University of California, San Francisco says that gene therapy could help restore patches of healthy tissue on a struggling liver. The successful experiments were run on a mouse model. "Right now we have shown that we can turn this one cirrhosis causing cell type into normal liver cells that function." And of course, we&#x2019;d always prefer to prevent damage to our bodies before its irreparable. That&#x2019;s why Dr. Cindy Leung of the University of California, San Francisco warns against giving children too much soda. She says that sugary drinks can actually accelerate aging by shortening our telomeres. These are the protective caps on our chromosomes that protect our DNA and if shortened, can lead to a range of maladies. "Drinking less sugary beverages would be one way to either halt or slow down their telomere shortening process. We need to promote other health behaviors that would help to lengthen our telomeres." We also venture into the physics realm this week with chemist Kevin Wilson of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He&#x2019;s been working on predicting the size of cloud droplets. "We were absolutely thrilled to be able to, from a physical chemistry perspective and a surface chemistry perspective, provide some insight into a process that is quite important for understanding cloud droplet formation and climate change in particular."

    <description>If everyone acknowledged that added sugars in our diet are one of the most significant contributors to diseases like diabetes and heart attacks, there would be a better chance that public health agencies and municipalities could partner with industry to produce healthier products for people to consume. At least that&#x2019;s the hope of Kris Madsen of the University of California, Berkeley. She recently found that a soda tax in Berkeley led to lower consumption or sugary drinks. "I think some would say &#x201C;sugar-sweetened beverages have been unfairly singled out. They are not the only problematic item in our diet.&#x201D; This is true. There&#x2019;s a few things about them that really make them stand out. They are the largest source of added sugars in the American&#x2019;s diet. The other problem with sugar-sweetened beverages is that we don&#x2019;t usually compensate for those calories." Madsen&#x2019;s study found a 21 percent drop in soda consumption in low-income communities a year after the city of Berkeley passed an excise tax. Now other cities are looking to do this, too. "My hope is that there will be strong evaluations in place to see what&#x2019;s the impact then as this spreads to other places."</description>

    <description>There&#x2019;s new insight into how race and ethnicity affect health, thanks to new research at the University of California, San Francisco. Study leader Noah Zaitlen explains the connection. "People from different countries, from different communities get sick from different diseases, they respond differently to different medications. We know that some of that is because of differences in their genetics and some of that is because of differences in their environment." This includes exposure to pollution, differences in diet or stress levels, all of which scientists and doctors overlooked in the past in favor of genetics and ancestry. And this approach, Zaitlen says, has shaped the way patients get screened. "When you walk into a hospital right now, you fill out this form, you see two choices for ethnicity &#x2013; it can be Hispanic or non-Hispanic and then you have these racial categories and the selection can impact how you are treated. Diagnostic tests will get reported differently depending on which category you check." To better assess patients&#x2019; health, Zaitlen suggests that doctors include social and environmental factors, too.</description>

    <description>The Food and Drug Administration has approved a new drug that could halt multiple sclerosis, a devastating disease that affects hundreds of thousands of Americans. Neurologist Bruce Cree of the University of California, San Francisco, was part of the team testing ocrelizumab, which goes by the brand name Ocrevus. Cree explains that it targets B cells in the human body and blocks the inflammation that drives the disease. Most MS therapies in the past targeted T cells, which often had serious side effects. "You can have profound immunological effects and clinical benefits by just targeting B cells alone. And I think this is actually an important advance for multiple sclerosis because when you just target these cells without affecting T cells, you have less of a potential for adverse events due to broad spectrum immune suppression."</description>

    <description>If a brain functions normally, neuron excitation and inhibition work in balance. &#x201C;And when you have this good balance, then you have normal cognitive function. When this is disrupted, that&#x2019;s when people have seizures &#x2013; where you have excess excitation, dysregulated activity of the brain, and don&#x2019;t have appropriate inhibition.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s neurologist Mercedes Paredes of the University of California, San Francisco. She says researchers used to pay more attention to excitatory neurons in their studies and downplayed the role of inhibitory neurons. But according to Paredes these neurons are crucial for the newborns&#x2019; brain development. &#x201C;So excitatory neurons are the largest population and they pretty much are active, their normal function is what causes brain activity. It&#x2019;s the regulation of that function, the fine-tuning of that function, where we use inhibitory neurons.&#x201D; By understanding how inhibitory neurons develop, Paredes hopes to shed new light on the origin of neurological disorders, like seizures or epilepsy.</description>

    <description>Researchers may be a step closer to curing Alzheimer's disease. Robert Knight, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley discovered a new role of the hippocampus. This is the part of the brain where Alzheimer's often starts &#x2013; and this new insight could bring new hope to patients. "If you look at these patients with hippocampal damage, they have never been studied in what I would say, a sophisticated manner in terms of their language." That&#x2019;s because until now, the hippocampus was known only for storing new memories, but as Knight&#x2019;s study found, it's also involved in generating language. "It is not just being told what to do by the cortex and the language areas, they are both contributing to effective language capacities. It kind of elevates the hippocampus out of the memory field and puts it into a cognitive domain, in this case language." With this knowledge, Knight says new treatment strategies can be developed to restore both memory and language functions that are damaged in Alzheimer's patients.</description>

    <description>There&#x2019;s nothing like a trip back home to visit family and friends &#x2013; or attending a college reunion - to make you ponder the passage of time. And as we reported this past week on Science Today, University of California, Berkeley physicist Richard Muller has proposed a new theory about the flow of time. "My theory postulates that space and time are so tightly linked in general relativity, that if you create more space, you&#x2019;re creating more time. If the expansion of the universe, starting with the Big Bang and now coasting ahead is constantly creating more space, it must also be creating new time." Muller theorizes that that space between the galaxies and the newly created time is what we call &#x2018;now&#x2019;. Muller is collaborating with CalTech on this and has proposed using LIGO, an experiment that detects gravitational waves created by merging black holes, to test the theory. So we&#x2019;ll stay tuned on that one. And on the subject of space, we also spoke to radiobiologist Matt Coleman of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory about his work developing a medical device that provides a comprehensive in-flight medical diagnostic system. This will help NASA in their push to better understand the long-tern effects of space travel. "This tool we&#x2019;re building, you know we think it&#x2019;s going to have a huge health benefit, but it&#x2019;s going to have a huge research benefit &#x2026; and so getting this up into space and even on the International Space Station, it will have a huge benefit, just in the research that we can do." And a new curriculum for medical students at the University of California, San Francisco will help with better treatment for patients here on terra firma. Dr. Anna Chang, who helped develop Bridges, says one aspect is to help doctors better communicate with their patients &#x2013; including translating medical language commonly used into something patients, families and other care providers can comprehend. "So, starting with day one, we are asking our students to practice what the world looks like from their patients&#x2019; perspectives." These are just some of the University of California stories we covered this past week. Listen to these and other Science Today episodes on iTunes or Soundcloud.

    <description>People who have lived in poverty through their youth and midlife &#x2013; may be at greater risk of cognitive decline when they get older. That&#x2019;s according to Kristine Yaffe, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco. Yaffe has been following a group of young adults from 18 to 30 years old, until they reached their 50s and discovered a warning pattern. "What we found is those people who, most of the time, or some of the time were in the poverty range, or in hardship did slightly worse on the cognitive testing at midlife." The researchers tested memory, organizational skills and brain processing speed and are now working on interpreting these results. "Does this mean this is just the way people are and it&#x2019;ll stay this way? Does this mean it&#x2019;s the beginning of something that If that&#x2019;s the case, Yaffe says catching early signs of cognitive decline is very important for prevention and treatment later on."</description>

    <description>As we head off for a bit of a holiday break, here are a few stories to go with the season. First, not to put a damper on things &#x2013; but in case you decide to channel your inner Bob Cratchit and &#x201C;make rather merry&#x201D; &#x2013; you may want to take it a bit easy. Cardiologist Gregory Marcus of the University of California, San Francisco says that&#x2019;s because tis the season for &#x2018;holiday heart syndrome&#x2019;. Marcus explains that this term was coined in the 1970s to describe patients who experience a common and potentially dangerous form of heart palpitation. This happens after excessive drinking and it usually occurs around the winter holiday season. "Patients would present with their first episode of atrial fibrillation and these patients had no known underlying heart disease and it turned out that on further questioning, that they had quite a bit to drink prior to just coming in and prior to developing their palpitations." So, if you&#x2019;re planning to raise a glass, keep it in moderation. And what about those who have a more &#x2018;bah humbug&#x2019; feeling around the holidays &#x2013; or any day? Are some people just born to be happier than others? Psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky of UC Riverside says even if there are genetic influences on happiness, that does not mean people can&#x2019;t change. "If we can&#x2019;t really change our happiness set point, I believe you can change your happiness level. So, people can, with a lot of effort, become happier. And when it comes to something like slowing down adaptation &#x2013; why is that hard? Well, probably because adaptation is so hardwired. It&#x2019;s evolutionarily adaptive. It&#x2019;s just something that all human beings experience and it&#x2019;s hard to kind of fight a natural process."

    <description>From colonizing microbiomes to lowering the risk of allergies, breastfeeding is well known to have many health benefits in children. But what&#x2019;s happening on the cellular level is a little more uncertain. According to epidemiologist Janet Wojcicki of the University of California, San Francisco, early breastfeeding may in fact be linked to longer telomeres. These are the protective caps on our DNA. Shorter telomeres are known to increase the risk of chronic disease later on in life. "Early exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding to 6 months of age were associated with longer telomeres when children entered kindergarten/elementary school. Cause we know from other studies that breastfeeding has a whole array of benefits &#x2013; immunological, protective against respiratory illnesses, protective against obesity. But we don&#x2019;t really know in all cases what the mechanism is. And so the fact that it&#x2019;s impacting at the cellular level was very exciting." </description>

    <description>Will software engineers ever be able to outsmart hackers and build an unbreakable wall of defense? Dawn Song, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley says it&#x2019;s possible, but don&#x2019;t expect results in the near future. Part of the reason is due to artificial intelligence, or AI. &#x201C;On one hand AI &#x2013; these techniques can really help us to enhance our capabilities for defenders to build stronger defenses, but also on the other hand unfortunately it could be misused by attackers. In the long run, we do hope that the defenders will win, but in the short term it could make it easier for attackers to develop new attacks, but can be much, much harder for defenders to build sufficient defenses.&#x201D; So, what will it take for programmers to win this cat-and-mouse game? According to Song, the advancement of artificial intelligence allows researchers to better identify vulnerable spots in software installed on our smartphones, laptops and tablets.</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. Have some researchers underestimated the amount of methane emitted into the atmosphere? According to physicist Marc Fisher of the Berkeley Lab, they may have, at least in the San Francisco Bay Area. "We found that emissions are roughly one and a half to two times the emissions expected based on inventory estimates, counting how many landfills, how many cows, how many wastewater treatment plants, how many different things that might emit methane." Because methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, Fisher says their finding calls for better management of pollutant sources like landfills to reduce its contribution. And at UC Davis, we learned how sometimes in medicine, there are compounds that are found to be good for one thing, but not so great for another. Like in the case of NSAIDs, a class of anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen. Aldrin Gomes explains how NSAIDs are known to be linked to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke, but he and his colleagues have found they seem to be beneficial in cancer. "NSAIDs have been known to kill cancer cells and it&#x2019;s killing cancer cells by a similar mechanism as it&#x2019;s killing the healthy cells, so it&#x2019;s actually too good at doing a job, so it&#x2019;s ironic." Gomes and his team found that NSAIDs can harm heart tissue because it can reduce the heart cells&#x2019; ability to produce energy and it&#x2019;s a similar mechanism that some papers have shown NSAIDs can be used to treat cancer. One tip from Gomes &#x2013; to prevent cardiac cell death &#x2013; take vitamin C before ingesting an NSAID. They found it had preventative properties.

    <description>Despite their amazing ability to change color and camouflage, cephalopods like octopus and cuttlefish only have one type of light receptor in their eyes, giving them black and white vision. But a new theory proposed by graduate student Alexander Stubbs of the University of California, Berkeley explains how cephalopods might still have the ability to detect color through the manipulation of light. "There&#x2019;s a variety of pupil shapes in organisms in general. So you can have a vertical slit pupil, a dot pupil, like you or I might have, and that&#x2019;s generally speaking the best for overall image sharpness. If you have a pupil that has more off-axis distance, so a bigger aperture in photographic terms, then that narrows your depth of field. You have to really pay attention to what&#x2019;s going to be in focus and what&#x2019;s going to be out of focus. Now, with cephalopods, when you have that off-axis pupil, it actually splits the image colors into constituent wavelengths, much like a prism. They could use this to be able to effectively focus through colors instead of focusing through distance." </description>

    <description>Do you feel bad when you&#x2019;re moody, upset or depressed? Well, don&#x2019;t be. Negative emotions are not so bad. So says Iris Mauss, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley. &#x201C;We found that some people regard their negative emotions with some suspicion. But some people actually have what we call emotionally excepting stance. They regard their negative emotions as something very natural, part of life that doesn&#x2019;t need to be avoided or altered or pushed away.&#x201D; Turns out, this type of thinking may work in your favor. "Paradoxically, people who actually accept their own negative emotions more, tend to have less negative emotions when they face stressful events, and then overtime sort of like a healthy diet this decreased experience of negative emotions adds up to better psychological health, more well-being, satisfaction with life and also less depression.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>In the 1990s, oxytocin, the so called love hormone that reduces stress and anxiety, used to be a popular treatment in America. But this changed a couple of years ago. &#x201C;Oxytocin used to be FDA approved for use in the United States. It wasn&#x2019;t removed for any health related, or side effect related reason, it just sort of fell out of favor&#x201D;. That&#x2019;s Jennifer Mitchell, neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. She is conducting an oxytocin study to treat active military members suffering from PTSD and alcohol abuse. Mitchell says the hormone is practically side effect-free and should be put back on the market. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s an interesting conundrum because the question is what&#x2019;s the path to reapply through the FDA to make it available for everyone to use. And there are several drug companies now that are also developing intranasal oxytocin for other indications.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Want your children to be asthma and allergy free? You may want to consider getting a dog. Susan Lynch, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Francisco, has discovered this connection while studying microbes in newborn babies&#x2019; bodies. "Exposure in early life to a greater breadth of organisms seems to be beneficial and allows the system to accumulate a greater diversity of organisms, which really means a greater diversity of the microbial functions." In other words, the mixture of home dust and dog&#x2019;s dander, can help a child become immune to asthma later in life. This seems to contradict a well-known fact that pets can trigger allergies? But Lynch says timing is everything. &#x201C;In later life for example, if asthma or allergies have developed, then exposure to a dog will clearly will trigger allergies.&#x201D; So to prevent these immune diseases &#x2013; a pet should be brought home when a child is no older than one month. Editor's note: special thanks to Emma for taking the time out of her busy day to pose for the accompanying picture.</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. It&#x2019;s been over three decades since Dr. Michael Harrison of the University of California, San Francisco performed the first fetal surgery &#x2013; and now Harrison is teaming up with bioengineers at UC Berkeley to develop a better glue for fetal surgery. We met with engineer Phillip Messersmith to learn about this super adhesive, which is inspired by mussels. That&#x2019;s right, the edible ocean dwellers. "The idea that we could borrow ideas from the mussel and use them in a synthetic material is something that we embraced. And so if you want to do that, you have to at least have some basic level of understanding of how this glue works in nature." Meanwhile, in another collaboration between UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley, researchers have joined forces to help the scientific community get a better understanding of how mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus can infect isolated placental cells. UCSF virologist Lenore Pereira explains how they did this. "We infected these cells with both the prototype African strain and the Nicaraguan strain from the new epidemics that have been associated with microcephaly. Somehow, cells were more susceptible to the Nicaraguan strains." Preventing the chain of infection from mother to fetus remains a challenge, but we&#x2019;re glad to know scientists like Pereira and Dr. Eva Harris at UC Berkeley are on the case. It&#x2019;s also great to learn that researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are leading an international study to conduct the first comprehensive study of cool roofs in China. Staff scientist Ronnen Levinson says these are the white coatings that provide energy cost savings by reflecting more sunlight than an ordinary dark roof. "We were taking something that was well understood elsewhere in the world and extending it to a very important country with a very large population that&#x2019;s actively seeking to save energy and reduce its carbon footprint."

    <description>When it comes to spending on research and innovation, adult patients get way more benefits then children. That&#x2019;s according to pediatric surgeon Hanmin Lee of the University of California, San Francisco. &#x201C;The market for most drugs and devices is significantly better, bigger and more robust in the adult world.&#x201D; For health and medical corporations it&#x2019;s simply a matter of profit and numbers. They can get more clients from the adult population and there are currently more adults on this planet than children. But Lee thinks this approach can be changed. &#x201C;I think we just need to be staunch advocates for children. In the Bay Area with the immense amount of intellectual capacity and financial capacity, we have to energize the Bay area to invest in the health of our children going forward, because I firmly believe that the best investment that you can make is in the health of our children.&#x201D; Lee says one way to achieve that is to get pediatrics grants to provide more devices and therapeutics for children.</description>

    <description>How can a college dining hall make a difference when it comes to climate change? Get rid of the trays. That&#x2019;s just what Jill Horst, director of residential dining services at the University of California, Santa Barbara did in an effort to reduce the amount of food waste that the university produced. "It, just overall, was this big huge impact. The food waste per person, per tray, reduced by 50 percent. That&#x2019;s a lot! That's a significant impact to help with not only the food waste, but food cost." Psychology played a part in this in that people naturally want to load up a large tray with food. "So by removing - the trays, people are managing how to carry their food to the table. And by doing that they're not taking as much. They're taking you know smaller portions to start, and then they could get back up, and go have more food, but it really was about why do we want to reduce food waste, which reduced costs, which helps the environment."

    <description>If you want to have better stereoscopic vision, you may want to try your hand at dressmaking. Really. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, are enrolling participants in a study run by neuroscientist Adrian Chopin. They found previously that dressmakers had better stereovision than other professionals. &#x201C;If there is a specific pattern of a stereoscopic vision, we may use it as a form of training, to be tested by a training study. So we have people come in, they are not dressmakers. And then we will train them in dressmaking. &#x201D; The researchers will test participants&#x2019; stereoscopic vision before and after the training trying to spot any signs of improvement. &#x201C;That will have an excellent clinical implication because right now it is very expensive when people are trying to treat amblyopia. They may have to come see an optometrist and it is very expensive and takes a lot of time.&#x201D; Chopin says it is way cheaper to sharpen your stereovision with just threads and needles.</description>

    <description>When epidemiologists study cohorts &#x2013; or rather, a group of people who have commonalities such as age, ethnicity or social class &#x2013; they can often garner information that&#x2019;s beyond their original research. Janet Wojcicki of the University of California, San Francisco, has been following a Latina cohort that was recruited in pregnancy and followed for a number of years. "Our primary outcome was really to better understand factors that are related to obesity and development of chronic disease in early childhood, but we also measured telomeres &#x2013; the protective cap of the DNA." Shorter telomeres are associated with chronic disease development. Wojcicki found in this cohort that early, exclusive breastfeeding of infants was linked to longer telomeres. She says they are now looking into why this particular cohort has a very high rate of asthma. "So we&#x2019;re trying to understand, is it because we have a lot of obesity in our cohort? Is it something about the neighborhoods that families are living in, where they have environmental exposure? So, that&#x2019;s something else."</description>

    <description>It turns out that clouds can&#x2019;t be explained by your typical school science fair experiment. Recent research at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has identified a new mechanism behind the not-so-fluffy science of cloud droplet formation. Cloud droplets in the atmosphere never form from pure water but require a seed, or a small aerosolized particle that may originate anywhere from ocean sea spray to diesel combustion. Physical chemist Kevin Wilson and his team found that the size of a droplet depends on the particle&#x2019;s interaction with water, rather than its ability to dissolve. "What we found is that, unlike conventional thinking, organic molecules are actually, rather than dissolving in the bulk of the droplet to facilitate droplet formation, they reside at the surface of the cloud droplet. And their main mechanism for forming cloud droplets is lowering of surface tension." Given the important effects of clouds on the atmosphere, Wilson hopes these findings will improve the accuracy of climate change models.</description>

    <description>Should doctors pay more attention to pregnant women's mental health? Nicole Bush, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco, thinks the medical community shows little appreciation of what future mothers are going through psychologically. &#x201C;Currently it is not standard practice for obstetricians or primary care people working with pregnant women to even screen for depression or high levels of stress." ..which also affects their developing offspring and could lead to mental and physical problems after they are born. Children may be at risk of obesity, immune dysfunction and neurological disorders. "We would have massive public health improvement if we could prioritize screening and understanding the challenges that pregnant women face and providing support during pregnancy and early postpartum period to buffer the effects of stress or provide resources to get their needs met."</description>

    <description>What qualities spell academic success in schoolchildren? To answer this question, neuroscientist Fumiko Hoeft of the University of California, San Francisco is looking at a mentoring program for children with learning disabilities such as ADHD, and how certain traits may play into the educational process. The program&#x2019;s goal is to develop resilience and better learning practices in its students. "We&#x2019;re doing a study validating these mentoring programs, and see which aspects of resilience might we be able to promote. Motivation, grit, mindset &#x2013; these are all concepts that are very popular in education right now, on how to raise a successful child. So people have focused largely on academic achievement &#x2013; reading, language arts, science. math. But now there&#x2019;s an increased awareness that without motivation or without resilience and perseverance that your child is not going to succeed, even though their IQ might be high or their test scores might be initially high." The hope is to inspire a nation-wide evaluation of these types of mentoring programs and their impact on learning. </description>

    <description>Many mothers talk or sing to their newborns, but how does this really help babies&#x2019; development? Mercedes Paredes, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, thinks such stimulation might affect inhibitory neurons that keep fine-tuning and shaping infants&#x2019; brains during the first couple of months of their lives. &#x201C;These cells are reaching their target, these brain regions that control the development of motor skills, social skills and language skills. So, I imagine that they might play a role in that. And understanding how they do that will be important for parents. These are foundations of how the milestones develop.&#x201D; But Paredes adds, if these neurons become damaged &#x2013; during or soon after birth - that could trigger childhood psychiatric and neurological disorders &#x2013; like epilepsy. &#x201C;The first couple of months to a year of life are uniquely active for the brain and we need to do things to protect the brain or at least be cognizant of the potential damage that could happen.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Narrator: This is Science Today. Sustainable dining is a huge deal on college campuses and the University of California, Santa Barbara is no exception. In fact, for years they&#x2019;ve been taking an innovative approach towards reducing food waste that incorporates some behavioral psychology. Jill Horst, director of dining services, describes how they dealt with all the half-eaten apples they were noticing in their tray returns. Horst: 9:17 It wasn&#x2019;t because the apple wasn&#x2019;t good, but the apple was so large. 9:27 So &#x2026;we decided, well they have different sized apples, so why don&#x2019;t we take a look at what would be the best size apple that somebody could consume without any waste? Narrator: They found that a five to six ounce apple was the proper portion. And while the change resulted in much less waste in the dining hall, it wasn&#x2019;t without some initial push back from students. Horst: &#x201C;Uh, what happened to the apples? These are, like mini apples&#x201D;. But we never took anything away, we just sized things the right way. How do you educate them and why are you doing this? And you have a bunch of half-eaten apples as a display to say, this is why we&#x2019;re doing that. It really resonated with them.

    <description>A new version of biology&#x2019;s tree of life will likely make it into the science textbooks. Microbiologist Karthik Anantharaman of the University of California, Berkeley helped put together an updated version containing over one thousand newly discovered microscopic organisms. "Over the last 15 years, we have collected greater than a thousand genomes of organisms that have never been cultured or, say, studied in the lab." Narrator: The last big revolution of the tree of life took place about 30 years ago, when scientists declared 3 main categories of life. This included bacteria and archaea, which are single celled organisms, and eukaryote, which includes organisms like animals and plants. But despite this clarification, many microbes remained mysterious. "When you look at, say, all of these normal microbes that say we have discovered, we don&#x2019;t know what about 50% of their genes do. Now imagine the potential that's there to understand what these guys can do and then harness that for the future. So be it helping us treat diseases, digest food better, looking at our own microbiome and harnessing its potential." </description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. A recent UCLA study has found that diet and exercise can reduce protein build-ups linked to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease in those who have subtle memory loss, but have yet been diagnosed with dementia. "A few years ago, nobody ever thought that you could measure a change with just an exercise intervention, so there are some big advances being made." That&#x2019;s Alzhiemer&#x2019;s disease researcher Karen Gylys, who we interviewed recently at UCLA about her own novel work looking at Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease progression in the synapses. Since the disease is so complicated, Gylys explains it will take more than just one solution to stave it off, but she is bolstered by her work and those of her colleagues&#x2019;. And at the UC San Francisco, medical students and are excited to be part of a new curriculum called Bridges, gives us a glimpse into what doctors of the future may be like. Dr. Anna Chang, who helped develop the coursework, says they&#x2019;re basically pioneering the way medical students are being taught. "Never before have 150 first year medical students gone out to the clinical settings and been challenged to answer questions like, what do you see? What ideas do you have? And what can you do to improve the lives of patients? We are giving our medical students a chance to do so from the moment that they step in the door." And materials scientists and mechanical engineer Suveen Mathaudhu of UC Riverside describes how car manufacturers are striving to reduce carbon pollution and improve fuel efficiency by producing cars using lightweight materials without sacrificing strength. Mathaudhu says just the copper cabling alone in the average car, which is used for electrical conductivity, weighs about 300 pounds. "If we could get a fraction of that conductivity in aluminum, it would not only be cheaper to implement, it would be lighter weight. So, one of the interesting things that we can do is we can use nanostructured features in aluminum to maintain the conductivity that it has while boosting the strength of the aluminum."

    <description>How important is it for pregnant women to get enough sleep? Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have recently conducted a study linking the lack of a good night&#x2019;s rest to complications at delivery. &#x201C;Our study was the first to examine insomnia diagnosed during pregnancy and the risk of preterm birth. And our findings suggested that women with an insomnia diagnoses during pregnancy are at nearly two times higher risk for delivering before 34 weeks of gestation&#x201D;. That&#x2019;s UCSF clinical psychologist Jennifer Felder. She urges mothers to pay extra attention to sleeping patterns in order to protect their babies. &#x201C;And this is really important because In the United States one in 10 women deliver their babies preterm. And it is now the leading cause of death before the age of 5 globally.&#x201D; Scientists hope that by treating sleep disorders they could reduce the rate of preterm births.

    <description>When there&#x2019;s an outbreak of West Nile virus in California or dengue in Florida, county vector control districts will set up traps all over the place to capture mosquitoes and then test which were infected by the viruses in question. "That&#x2019;s how they are able to do surveillance work and figure out where they can concentrate their effort in cleaning up the mosquitoes." That&#x2019;s Anandasankar Ray, director of the Center for Disease Vector Research at the University of California, Riverside. Ray and his colleagues are using environmentally-friendly volatile molecules that can be formulated in little bottles to create affordable traps that can be set up in backyards for people to use. "At the moment, the traps that are available in the market that are successful usually have a big tank of propane or butane that it burns. They&#x2019;re quite expensive. And so we feel that by using volatile odors that are safe and that can mimic carbon dioxide, we may be able to create low-cost traps, affordable ones that can be used by vector control in developing countries as well."</description>

    <description>About a quarter of all the global climate change problems we&#x2019;re seeing today can be attributed back to our food system and the dietary choices we&#x2019;re making on a daily basis. "This is greater than all of the cars on the planet; in fact it&#x2019;s about twice as much global warming pollution as the cars." That&#x2019;s Benjamin Houlton, director of the John Muir Institute of the Environment at the University of California, Davis. He studies the connection between climate and diet. For instance, just switching from a meat-heavy American diet to a Mediterranean diet, which has less meat, more fish and lots of vegetables is not only good for your health, it&#x2019;s good for the planet&#x2019;s health, too. "If we all switch to a diet like the Mediterranean diet &#x2013; that is equivalent to taking somewhere around a billion cars off of the streets in terms of vehicle emissions each year. So, it&#x2019;s a huge number that has a tremendous amount. In terms of percentages, it could solve up to 15 percent of global warming pollution by 2050. We thing these are really important things to understand; our dietary choice does matter and it&#x2019;s something we can do every day."</description>

    <description>Artificial Intelligence has been developing fast &#x2013; and it&#x2019;s making more and more decisions on humans&#x2019; behalf. From simple web searches to e-commerce to self-driving cars. But researchers like Dawn Song, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, are struggling to find the best ways to protect this technology from hackers. &#x201C;One thing we are looking at how we can use AI and deep learning techniques to develop stronger security capabilities to enable us to build better defenses. One of our recent works uses advanced deep learning techniques to try to identify software vulnerabilities in IOT devises.&#x201D; Deep learning techniques are advanced algorithms, which allow researchers to process massive amounts of data. &#x201C;The advantage of deep learning is that it can enable us to build very large data sets. And now we have very good computation framework and hardware to perform a variety of tasks.&#x201D; But as machines becomes smarter, so do viruses that attack them, so scientists are challenged to stay one step ahead of hackers.</description>

    <description>If your home has furniture that contains flame retardant materials, you may want to consider getting rid of it. A study by Tracey Woodruff, an environmental health scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, has shown that exposure to flame retardant chemicals, or PBDEs, may affect your health. "The thing about the flame retardants use in a polyurethane foam is that they are not bound to the polyurethane, so they can get out and they can get into dust, and then they can migrate through dust, and people can get exposed through the dust, and they can also get into food. Another thing about PBDEs is that their chemical structure is such that it makes them persistent: once they get out they don&#x2019;t break down, they hang around in the environment." According to Woodruff, pregnant women and children are especially vulnerable. PBDEs may slow down children&#x2019;s neurodevelopment, lower their IQ and possibly increase the risk of ADHD. "Children may be more highly exposed to PBDEs, as it gets out in dust, because they are lower to the ground, they crawl around, they put their hands in their mouth." So, not having furniture with these chemicals is the safest bet.</description>

    <description>As America is becoming more culturally and ethnically diverse, researchers are trying to pin down the features of preschools to benefit all children. According to a new study by Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, African-American children get the most out of a high-quality, rigorous curriculum. &#x201C;The biggest effect from academic-oriented preschool, the largest punch is felt by poor African American kids. They are ahead by three to four months relative to children that stay at home. &#x201D; The results for children from Latino families came out differently. "We did find modest social development on Latino kids from quality preschool, but we didn&#x2019;t find same cognitive growth. Whether that&#x2019;s a shortage of bilingual teachers, whether the quality of these programs for Latino kids is weak, we really are not sure.&#x201D; Fuller says the study adds to the growing debate on what types of preschools should be nurtured in America to improve our pre-K education.</description>

    <description>If you are a parent and a smoker, your children&#x2019;s DNA may be affected, even if you quit smoking before conception. Adam de Smith an associate researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, has found that prenatal smoking by either parent can cause what&#x2019;s called a genetic deletion in their children. De Smith: 7:40 It is a chunk of DNA that&#x2019;s missing from a chromosome. The health effects are really to do with a particular area or region of DNA that is deleted. If this region includes important genes, than it usually lead to a health effect.&#x201D; The researchers looked at the gene deletions in the immune system, which can cause acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer. &#x201C;Thankfully, nowadays cure rates are upwards of 85-90 percent. Even though they have survived the cancers, they go on to health issues in later life. For example, increase risks of heart disease, pulmonary disease and also increased secondary cancer rates. Ideally, we would like to prevent childhood leukemia in the first place.&#x201D; ]</description>

    <description>The Food and Drug Administration has been putting bigger warning labels on pain relievers like ibuprofen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS. That&#x2019;s because of their known risk to increase heart disease and stroke. At the University of California, Davis, researcher Aldrin Gomes has found that when taken for prolonged periods, NSAIDs can cause cardiac cells to die. So, Gomes says part of their effort is to educate certain age groups. "Between 45 and 65, your risk of stroke from natural causes increases. And above 65, it increases even further. And when you add NSAIDs to this, at these different age groups, it further increases your risk." Since many people typically start using NSAIDs the most as they age, Gomes says it&#x2019;s imperative to educate those 45 and older to stop using them on a regular basis. For those listening who may be concerned about previous usage and the damage it may have caused, Gomes offers simple advice. "We can&#x2019;t change what we have done, we can only change what we can do."</description>

    <description>There are still many misconceptions about radiation. While radioactivity exists naturally in the background of our daily lives, it&#x2019;s also a topic of fear since it&#x2019;s linked to nuclear disasters like Fukushima and Chernobyl. But nuclear physicist Kai Vetter and his team at the University of California, Berkeley are trying to change that. "We have established what we call the Berkeley DoseNet program, aiming at providing simple radiation sensors to communities and to high schools, to enable the broader public to learn about the world we&#x2019;re living in. Because what they measure is naturally occurring radioactivity, and can use that to apply science and engineering concepts." Currently, DoseNet is a network of high schools across Northern California. "We&#x2019;re also reaching out to other places across the world, because what we envision is to establish a global sensor network." For those curious to learn more, these radiation measurements are now available online at https://radwatch.berkeley.edu/ </description>

    <description>Genome sequencing, which is figuring out the order of genetic letters in your DNA code, will most likely become a standard testing procedure in the next decades. This, according scientist Diane Dickel of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This will help identify diseases you might be prone to. "We&#x2019;ll continue to accelerate people getting the whole genome sequencing as a routine type of genetic testing rather than what previously been done which is testing a few genes for mutations.&#x201D; Now, doctors mostly perform genetic testing for people with heart problems or a history of breast cancer, since these diseases have a strong genetic component. &#x201C;We could use it better for preventative or monitoring types of mechanisms, being able to identify genetically which people should have yearly mammograms vs maybe mammograms every 5 years.&#x201D; Dickel hopes in the future, more diseases, like diabetes, which is less understood genetically, can be studied with DNA sequencing.</description>

    <description>You&#x2019;ve most probably seen holograms in the media and in the movies &#x2013; these are 3D images formed by the interference of light beams from a laser. Now, imagine it being applied to internal organs to detect disease, specifically in the colon. At the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Judy Yee is doing just that for about 20 percent of her CT colonography cases. "I was first introduced to it by EchoPixel and was able to combine my knowledge of colonic pathology and disease and what I know about CT colonography to work with them, to develop sort of the next step in where to go with CT colonography." The goal is to make this a study that&#x2019;s appealing to patients to prevent disease. "But also to make it easier for the radiologists who interpret these studies, to make it engaging and easier and as accurate, if not more accurate."</description>

    <description>Mothers who smoke during pregnancy and after birth put their children at increased risk of a common type of childhood cancer. This, according to a new University of California, San Francisco study. Adam de Smith says their work is the first to find an association between maternal smoking and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. &#x201C;In the mothers who are exposed to tobacco smoke, there was a higher rate of deletion in the fetal cells that was likely caused by a particular mechanism. It is an innate mechanism in our immune system, which functions to create antibodies to particularly create diversity in our antibodies. And we think when this mechanism goes wrong, or goes into overdrive and has abnormal effects, it can increase the risk of causing deletions in genes around across the genome.&#x201D; Deletions are genetic mutations that can lead to cancer and other diseases. &#x201C;We think that the tobacco smoke maybe increasing the abnormal effects of this immune mechanism, that lead to increased deletions. And this maybe through inflammation, because we know tobacco smoke has inflammatory properties.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Studies have found that people who believe that alcohol is good for the heart, drink more. While this is not surprising, cardiologist Gregory Marcus of the University of California, San Francisco, says the question is &#x2013; what are the real benefits of drinking? "Whereas there is some evidence that moderate consumption of alcohol might help prevent heart attacks, there was also evidence that alcohol may increase the risk for high blood pressure, it might increase the risk for heart failure. And then there is growing evidence that alcohol may increase the risk for atrial fibrillation." That is the most common abnormal heart rhythm, which may cause stroke. "There is no randomized data to demonstrate that consumption of alcohol can reduce a heart attack. All of the data has been what we call observational, and we know from previous studies that observational data can fool us." So Marcus recommends that drinkers pace themselves: no more than one drink a day for women and for men, no more than two drinks a day.</description>

    <description>How might your brain respond to a word spoken in a sentence, rather than alone or without meaningful context? Rather than looking at how the brain responds to single words, neuroscientist Alexander Huth of the University of California, Berkeley wanted to create a more natural environment to study semantics, or the meaning of language. "We call this a &#x201C;naturalistic&#x201D; approach to this kind of experiment, where instead of&#x2026;showing people single words or single sentences, we&#x2019;re just showing them a continuous narrative, a full story, as language is used. And that has certain advantages in that we see sort of how the brain actually works when you&#x2019;re understanding language." With these conditions, the researchers then built models able to predict brain activity, and tested them by playing unfamiliar radio stories for the subjects. "It turns out that our models, based on semantics, predict really really well in a bunch of brain areas." Huth and his team are currently looking into other nuances of language and the human brain, such as whether the response is different when it comes to speaking versus hearing. </description>

    <description>Researchers have found a new strategy for treating multiple sclerosis, which affects about 2 million people globally. This chronic disease is incurable and can paralyze the brain and spinal cord when the immune system attacks the body. The progressive form of the disease is especially dangerous. "And it is typically characterized by weakness and numbness in a leg, then spreading to the other leg and gradually involving more and more of body in terms of disability." That&#x2019;s neurologist Bruce Cree of the University of California, San Francisco. He&#x2019;s been testing a new drug in clinical trial that&#x2019;s designed to reduce MS symptoms and found that patients&#x2019; brain inflammation was practically gone. "This was very impressive and suggests that we have a highly effective therapy. There is some advantage in medication in terms of tolerability, in terms of efficacy and I think it&#x2019;s going to be a very important new therapy." The drug is called ocrelizumab and it&#x2019;s currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration.</description>

    <description>Sometimes the best ideas are found in nature. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers at the Biomimetic Millisystems Laboratory have long looked to insects and animals for inspiration in their robotic designs; from cockroaches to lizards. Now, roboticist Duncan Haldane says their latest creation called Salto took a cue from nature and it can jump higher and faster than any other robot out there. "Salto is inspired by a galago, which is bushbaby. Biologists have found animals adapted specifically for jumping had this kind of super crouch posture. The longer they stay in a crouch, the more energy they can transfer into the tendons and the more energy they can return for jumping." Now that Salto is jumping as well as these small primates, they&#x2019;re looking to humans to explore different behaviors. "The closest model for what we&#x2019;re trying to do is human parkour. You have these people that excel at running over buildings, bouncing off of all these crazy obstacles like a wall as a feature to help yourself move."</description>

    <description>A recent collaboration between the University of California, San Francisco and international researchers has revealed some surprising genes linked to limb development in bats. Associate professor Nadav Ahituv studies human limb malformations and says these are novel genes that were not previously associated with limb development at all. "For example, one gene that we see is expressed specifically in elongating digits three to five in the developing bat, but in mice, they&#x2019;re not expressed in that location. And so it looks like bats adopted that gene to work in that location, and making it an important gene for wing development. We found genes that are involved in apoptosis and cell death. So when our limbs grow, we basically have webbing between them, and then that webbing sort of dies, but in the bat forelimbs, that webbing remains and makes part of the wing." Ahituv says their work offers insight into the unique growth of arms and legs in other mammals such as ourselves. </description>

    <description>Our brains take more time to develop than was previously thought. Those were the findings of a new study conducted by neurologist Mercedes Paredes of the University of California, San Francisco. &#x201C;The old dogma has been that a lot of the development that happened after birth was more related to fine tuning, changes such as white matter development and synaptic connections, the connections between brain cells or neurons.&#x201D; But Paredes has found that the brain is still developing &#x2013; significantly right after birth, with young neurons moving to the frontal lobe of the brain, where they then become functional. &#x201C;And that is something new, both in terms of how long brain development is still ongoing, but also the fact that this is period right around the time of birth and there is a lot of pathological changes that can happen and the brain is vulnerable.&#x201D; So trying to understand what&#x2019;s happening in newborn babies&#x2019; brains will help scientists get a better sense of what triggers developmental disorders.</description>

    <description>A tool to improve the computer network security of government agencies, along with state and local governments, has been developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Computer scientist Domingo Colon says their network mapping system, called NeMS, gives network managers a comprehensive view of their computer network environments. "So there are a lot of tools out there that provide different vantage points of network security, but what we needed was something a lot more specific that told us behaviorally what&#x2019;s happening on our network, and also structurally, how is the composition of our network put together at any point in time. These things provide what&#x2019;s called &#x201C;attack surface&#x201D; for someone from the external world and what you want, as an enterprise, is to reduce that surface." Colon says the next step is to provide this type of capability to a larger pool of people. "We&#x2019;re hoping through our commercial partner, that they will be able to have that level of reachability into other segments of the general public, particularly the commercial entities out there that can also make use of this technology." </description>

    <description>Soda consumption in the United States fell to a 31-year low last year. This, according to the trade publication, Beverage-Digest. Instead, consumers seem to be reaching for lower-calorie products, including bottled water. This is something public health professor Kristine Madsen found in a University of California, Berkeley study, which was conducted after the City of Berkeley passed the nation&#x2019;s first soda tax in 2014. "Even in the comparison cities of Oakland and San Francisco, there was an overall increase of 20 percent in water consumption. But it was 63 percent in Berkeley. So, it looks like people were switching from sugar-sweetened beverages to really what I would say is the healthiest alternative." Madsen agrees that many consumers are becoming more health conscious. But even trends could have a role in the decline of sugary drinks &#x2013; like all of the eco-friendly water bottles being carried around these days. "So, that &#x2018;cool factor&#x2019; is really important and could absolutely be an important driver moving people to healthier choices, you now, in beverages and in diets in general."</description>

    <description>If you want to protect yourself from a dangerous foodborne infection called Listeriosis, don&#x2019;t store food in the fridge for too long. &#x201C;A lot of bacteria can&#x2019;t grow when you store the food in the refrigerator, but Listeria is actually one of the few things that can grow at refrigerator temperature. &#x201D; That&#x2019;s a piece of advice from microbiologist Anna Bakardjiev of the University of California, San Francisco. She&#x2019;s studied the bacteria Listeria, which causes the disease, and says it&#x2019;s not very choosy. &#x201C;Cheeses or fruits, there was an outbreak associated with coleslaw where the cabbage had been in the cool house for a relatively long time. Any kind of food had been implicated.&#x201D; So Bakardjiev says to prevent an infection that sickens hundreds of Americans every year, eat your food while it&#x2019;s still fresh. And if you do have leftovers, like stew, reheat it thoroughly.</description>

    <description>After a &#x2018;soda tax&#x2019; took effect in low-income neighborhoods in Berkeley, California, researchers discovered the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages took a steep dive in these communities. Study author Kris Madsen of the University of California, Berkeley says instead, those surveyed in these neighborhoods, which often have high rates of obesity and diabetes, reported making healthier choices like drinking more water. Madsen says this is an encouraging sign from a public health perspective. &#x201C;Look, it is a little bit like a luxury tax on alcohol or cigarettes. It&#x2019;s fine. It is your choice. But clearly it should only happen occasionally. We tried to reduce smoking in the United States for many years, and it really was only effective once the tax went into effect.&#x201D; Madsen adds that such taxes are successful examples of intervention since it has an impact on people&#x2019;s health and generates revenue. "I feel like we&#x2019;ll continue to look for the tools that are the most effective tools to change, to improve population health.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>One way to fight what&#x2019;s called &#x2018;urban heat islands&#x2019; &#x2013; a phenomenon in which dark-colored roads and buildings bring cities&#x2019; air temperature up &#x2013; is to change the color of the pavement. That&#x2019;s according to Ronnen Levinson, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. &#x201C;You can choose a more reflective pavement surface instead of a darker less reflective pavement surface. The more reflective pavement surface will stay cooler in the sun. It also won&#x2019;t heat the air of the city as much as the darker, hotter pavement will.&#x201D; But there are trade-offs; Levinson was part of a team that found that the energy spent on manufacturing light-colored pavements can lead to increased carbon emissions. &#x201C;We found that in many cases switching to a more reflective pavement technology, for example, a light grey cement concrete pavement in place of a black asphalt concrete pavement, requires much more energy and carbon.&#x201D; So Levinson says city officials need to keep this in mind when they choose pavements.</description>

    <description>Exposure to flame retardant chemicals or PBDEs during pregnancy can affect children&#x2019;s neurodevelopment. That&#x2019;s according to Tracey Woodruff, an environmental health scientist at the University of California, San Francisco. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s been studies in multiple locations including the United States and in other countries around the world and what was found was that women with higher exposures to PBDEs during pregnancies, their children had lower IQ scores.&#x201D; Woodruff says they measured IQ scores of 5 to 7-year-old exposed to these chemicals in infancy. &#x201C;For about 10-fold increase in PBDEs there was a drop of IQ score of about 4 IQ points." But how did women get exposed to the chemicals? Turns out, through furnishings at home. &#x201C;PBDE flame retardants are the class of chemicals that were used primarily in upholstered furniture, so polyurethane foam. They were put in as a requirement to flammability standards. They are also used sometimes in electronics."</description>

    <description>Can you expect a colonoscopy performed via CT scan to be as accurate as a conventional colonoscopy? Physician Judy Yee of the University of California, San Francisco says innovative CT colonographies, or CTCs, are becoming a good alternative. "CT colonography is an imaging test that we would like to use for not only diagnosis of colorectal cancer, but for screening for colorectal cancer. There are many peer-reviewed papers and research that&#x2019;s been done, including here, comparing the traditional CT colonography method to colonoscopy and have found that they&#x2019;re pretty much equivalent for the clinically significant polyps. The true 3D, or the virtual holographic version of CT colonography is expected to be as accurate, if not more accurate." Yee is currently conducting larger studies on the procedure, which has proven to have multiple benefits. "So that&#x2019;s another advantage, actually, of the CTC, is that you don&#x2019;t need sedation at all." </description>

    <description>Hey there! This week on Science Today, we learned how the sense of smell impacts our metabolism. According to Andrew Dillin, a molecular biologist at UC Berkeley, if there is a lack of smell the body is wired to burn all the food that comes in. It doesn&#x2019;t store any of it. And Dillin discovered that lab animals lacking a sense of smell remained thin even after gorging on fatty food. &#x201C;There is something about the wiring of the sensory system of smell into the brain to control the rest of the body&#x2019;s metabolism." But before you think you&#x2019;ve found the perfect diet, Dillin says scientists still don&#x2019;t know exactly how the sensory organs for smell are integrated with the brain. That requires more research in the lab &#x2013; and then there will be more work looking into if the mice research translates to humans. While on campus, we visited psychologist Robert Levenson, who told us that when it comes to looking after loved ones with dementia, caregivers really need to give it their all. &#x201C;If you are not able to bring your A game to caregiving, the whole quality of caregiving might suffer. As caregivers get more depressed, their level of the stress sort of permeates the entire household. It might be almost contagious in a way that a virus would be contagious. But this would be a psychological virus." Levenson hopes that social services can step in to help caregivers who are depressed, which would not only improve their quality of life, but boost the mortality of the dementia patients they&#x2019;re looking after. Well, that&#x2019;s it for this week. To hear more stories about University of California research, check out UC Science Today on iTunes or Soundcloud.

    <description>We&#x2019;ve all heard that vitamin C is good for the immune system, but can it also protect our hearts from damaging drugs? Associate Professor Aldrin Gomes of the University of California, Davis says the antioxidant might in fact buffer the heart from NSAIDs, or common pain relievers like Ibuprofen. Their chronic use is known to cause side effects such as heart problems, even cardiac cell death. So to learn more, Gomes turned to the lab. "Vitamin C is readily available, and it&#x2019;s easy to test and easy to understand the mechanism. We pre-treated the cells with vitamin C before we gave NSAIDs, and this prevented cell death." Gomes explains NSAIDs can reduce the ability of cardiac cells to make energy and cause a toxic buildup of cells. But on top of this protective effect, vitamin C also has mild pain relieving properties. "So together, it would actually be pretty useful for pain relief. We don&#x2019;t know if this will work in humans, but our longer term goal is to see if taking vitamin C together with the NSAID will prevent the side effects." </description>

    <description>In an effort to reduce carbon pollution and improve fuel economy, auto manufacturers are racing to produce cars using lightweight materials without sacrificing strength. The average car has about 300 pounds worth of cabling alone. This is for electrical conductivity. Materials scientist and mechanical engineer Suveen Mathaudhu of the University of California, Riverside says most of it is made out of pricey, thick copper. "If we could get a fraction of that conductivity in aluminum it would not only be cheaper to implement, it would be lighter weight even though it will never had the conductively that copper will inherently have &#x2013; and so one of the interesting things that we can do is we can use nanostructured features in aluminum to maintain the conductivity that it has while boosting the strength of the aluminum. And that provides motivation for people to start using lighter weight conductive aluminum cable versus copper cable, which now comes at a cost premium and a weight premium as well, so you&#x2019;re solving two problems at once."</description>

    <description>Every year, almost 2 million Americans suffer from traumatic brain injury, which often lead to severe memory loss and learning disabilities. Peter Walter, a biochemist at the University of California, San Francisco, has recently discovered a drug that can completely reverse these impairments in mice. &#x201C;The mice learned better. They have a better ability of taking short term memory and storing it in long term memory. It is a drug that enhances synaptic plasticity that allow memory to form.&#x201D; Scientists need to conduct more studies to learn if the same improvements can be achieved in humans. &#x201C;Whether we can extrapolate it to humans is still an open question. Mice&#x2019; brains are very different from human brains.&#x201D; But since traumatic brain injury is a serious problem with no approved therapies available for patients, these studies may offer researchers new insight.

    <description>Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco have recently discovered the origin of Listeriosis. This is a foodborne disease that often strikes pregnant women and could affect the fetus, too. Microbiologist Anna Bakardjiev discovered a protein secreted by Listeria bacteria attacks the placenta &#x2013; and this was surprising to her. "There are only very few pathogens that can infect the placenta and the baby during pregnancy. Placenta and the fetus are very protected against infection." But that specific protein has found a way to break through the placenta's protective barrier and help bacteria grow there rapidly. These findings challenge current thinking that a pregnant woman's weakened immune system increases susceptibility to the infection. "This is the first time I think for any kind of infection that we have identified the protein that is specifically important for the infection of the placenta." Bakardjiev says, this could help scientists develop new strategies to prevent and treat Listeriosis and other pregnancy complications triggered by infections.</description>

    <description>Researchers may have narrowed down the origins of asthma and allergies to just one molecule. Susan Lynch, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Francisco and her colleagues at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit have found a metabolite - a product of metabolism - that can trigger the diseases. "There was a specific Lipid called 12, 13-diHome. This specific lipid is an established biomarker for asthma in adults, and we are finding it in the heightened concentration in neonates who go on to develop asthma in childhood". The researchers have also discovered how this molecule affects babies' immune systems. "That specific lipid actually suppresses the critical cell type, the T- regulatory cells that are necessary to dampen allergic inflammation". Lynch explains that the weakening of these cells is one of the most critical immune dysfunctions that underlie allergies.</description>

    <description>A 3D mammogram could be more effective for women with dense breasts than a regular mammography test. That&#x2019;s because a three-dimensional scan is easier to detect abnormalities in dense tissue. This according to breast cancer researcher Karla Kerlikowske of University of California, San Francisco. But the technology has not been widely used yet. While the FDA approved the devises 5 years ago, only 30 percent of clinics across the country purchased them. Kerlikowske says more studies are needed to prove how reliable 3D scanners are. &#x201C;The technology often, in particular for devices - not for drugs, for drugs there is always randomized trials - they don&#x2019;t say you can use this drug for such and such until the FDA approves it. But when it comes to devices, they often get released before there is evidence to show that they are really better than what exists.&#x201D; But Kerlikowske hopes she will soon have the data. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s actually grants we are working on now to try and figure that out who benefits the most from that technology".</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. If you look on the back of a bottle of multivitamins, you might recognize some metal nutrients like zinc and iron. But would you recognize copper as a major contributor to human health? We speak with chemist Chris Chang of the University of California, Berkeley, who discovered that copper actually helps mice burn fat. "And so what happens is that if the mice don&#x2019;t have enough copper in their fat cells, then they can&#x2019;t undergo this process of fat burning, the act of breaking larger pieces of fat into smaller pieces of fat for energy." And it turns out that this lack of copper can set the stage for obesity. Our bodies require many nutrients to thrive, but other compounds might be outright harmful. Consider chemotherapy drugs, which can be toxic to the body and cause brutal side effects. That&#x2019;s why researcher Chelsea Chen of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory created a small device called the ChemoFilter. This acts as chemical sponge to absorb the excess drug before it spreads to the rest of the body. "It is used to capture the chemotherapy drug, that&#x2019;s past the tumor, before it enters the body&#x2019;s circulation." The device can then be removed from the body after treatment. We also chat with bioinformatics scientist Jonathan Allen of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory about a new national panel that will study how microbial communities affect human health in &#x201C;built environments&#x201D; like an office building or even a hospital. "How can we apply the current technologies that are being used to study the microbiome in a broad array of research areas and apply them to really advance the field in building design and interactions with people?"

    <description>With the ongoing epidemic, Zika virus remains an ominous diagnosis for pregnant mothers. Since little was known about this disease prior to the outbreak, scientists are working quickly to close the research gap. Neurologist Arnold Kriegstein of the University of California, San Francisco recently identified a molecular bridge that could allow Zika to enter a baby&#x2019;s brain from the bloodstream. Before, Zika&#x2019;s use of this channel was mainly hypothetical. "But now, we do have access to the virus from Brazil, and we are actually doing these experiments. We&#x2019;re taking these live cells and we&#x2019;re exposing them to the virus." Kriegstein and his team will look at a variety of cell types, including developing neurons known as radial glial cells. "We&#x2019;re also looking not just at the radial glial cells, which we expect will be infected, but other cell types, some of which we don&#x2019;t expect to be infected. If we can understand the mechanism of how the virus is invading the brain, how it&#x2019;s causing microcephaly that may provide some therapeutic targets that you could use to block the infection at some level." </description>

    <description>When it comes to the future of medicine, think digital! That&#x2019;s what researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, along with tech giants like Google and Intel - are doing. UCSF pediatric surgeon Hanmin Lee is converting troves of medical records into digital format and storing them in a unified online database. &#x201C;We do have collaborations through our digital center for health innovation. When we are able to get a power of what I would argue at UCSF, the singular world&#x2019;s leading research medical institution, and as an aggregate the UC system, really the world&#x2019;s leading system of academic medical centers, partnering up with the leading companies that make processors that can do machine learning and can do deep learning like Intel, have companies like Cisco and GE that are interface between devices and data, I think it is such a powerful combination, I think that&#x2019;s exactly where medicine is heading.&#x201D; Lee says the digital era of medicine will open new doors for experimental studies and the quality of treatment.</description>

    <description>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a historic travel alert for pregnant women going to Florida, where over a dozen cases of the Zika virus have been reported. This makes the outbreak in South America now a lot closer to home. At the University of California, San Francisco, researcher Lenore Pereira discovered how the Zika virus can infect isolated placental cells. "We infected these cells with both the prototype African strain and the Nicaraguan strain from the new epidemics that have been associated with microcephaly." The first human cases of Zika were reported in Uganda in the 1950s. "We realized that it was an interesting comparison because the Ugandan strain required more virus to infect placental cells than the Nicaraguan strains. Somehow, cells were more susceptible to the Nicaraguan strains." But preventing the chain of infection from mother to fetus still remains a challenge. </description>

    <description>One of the most important developments in science in the last couple of years has been engineering immune cells to fight cancer. But so far, the technique has not always been successful. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, are now trying to increase the power of immune white blood cells &#x2013; called T-cells - to kill tumors. Molecular scientist Wendell Lim may have found a way. "What we have been developing is a new ways of programming t-cells so we can actually flexibly change their behavior." Lim says to achieve this, they have created microscopic robots that can move through the body and are now teaching them how to find cancer. "We have developed a new type of sensor molecule called synthetic notch receptor that we can put in these T-cells and their receptors can be programed to recognize molecules that are unique to cancer." The future of these molecules could not only help fight tumors, but also combat autoimmune diseases and other physical or mental disorders.</description>

    <description>It&#x2019;s time for the weekly roundup again; first &#x2013; when you think about preschool, you may think it&#x2019;s all about quality. And while that&#x2019;s certainly true, we learned that quantity of time spent in pre-K education is just as important. Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the UC Berkeley says this is especially the case for kids from low-income families. &#x201C;If kids were growing up in poor households, a lot of these parents were working swing shifts, grave yard shifts, or they can&#x2019;t afford high quality children&#x2019;s books. So it is probably a resource problem. But when young kids are growing up in these more impoverished settings, then a quality pre-school can pack a much bigger punch." The same study found that middle-class kids showed no change in their academic performance if they stayed in preschool a whole day vs. half a day. And over at UC San Francisco, we learned more about the study linking maternal smoking with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer. Adam de Smith says that moms who smoke during pregnancy and after birth are putting their children at risk of the disease. &#x201C;In the mothers who are exposed to tobacco smoke, there was a higher rate of deletion in the fetal cells that was likely caused by a particular mechanism. It is an innate mechanism in our immune system, which functions to create antibodies to particularly create diversity in our antibodies. And we think when this mechanism goes wrong, or goes into overdrive and has abnormal effects, it can increase the risk of causing deletions in genes around across the genome.&#x201D; You can hear these and much more stories about University of California research by following Science Today on iTunes.

    <description>What will doctors of the future be like? The medical school at the University of California, San Francisco has launched a unique curriculum called Bridges, which may offer us a glimpse into how future physicians will be trained. Dr. Anna Chang, a professor of geriatric medicine, was involved in planning Bridges from the start. "We are pioneering the way that we're teaching medical students and we are ahead of others in the country in the scope and depth of what we're doing." Chang explains that doctors practicing today started medical school by just memorizing facts. So what makes Bridges so different? "Never before have 150 first-year medical students gone out to the clinical settings and been challenged to answer questions like, what do you see? What ideas do you have? And what ca you do to improve the lives of patients? So, we are giving our medical students a chance to do so from the moment that they step in the door."</description>

    <description>A new study from the University of California, San Francisco may help physicians treat inflammation in diabetic patients without causing complete suppression of the immune system. Endocrinologist Suneil Koliwad recently discovered the mechanism behind the inflammation that occurs when particular immune cells known as macrophages are exposed to excess saturated fats. "We might have uncovered an inroad into a way that we could alleviate the form of inflammation that goes on in the fat tissue where lipids may serve as a trigger, but still allow the macrophages in the tissue to remain responsive to triggers of inflammation that might represent infection or injury. To stimuli that we would want to maintain responsiveness against." Immune suppression drugs may often keep over-the-top immune reactions in check, but they can also put the person at risk of other conditions. Koliwad says the next step is to hone in even more on this pathway to see how it may help scientists develop better diabetes drugs. Photo by Steve Gschmeissner. </description>

    <description>Your mental state often affects the way you handle uncomfortable situations. Jennifer Mitchell, neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco has recently tested what she calls stress reactivity of patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, and alcohol abuse. &#x201C;We make people nervous in a social situation. And that induces really robust cortisol response, increase in heart rate, changes in respiration and blood pressure. And we administer either oxytocin or placebo and then we look to see whether oxytocin enables people to be less nervous and less apprehensive in that situation.&#x201D; The oxytocin therapy reduces stress and anxiety and also helps patients be more resilient to alcohol cravings. &#x201C;A lot of people who have troubles with alcohol use disorder and PTSD are self medicating. They are anxious, they are stressed, they are fearful and they find that drinking alcohol ameliorates some of those problems.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>The &#x2018;silver tsunami&#x2019; is a metaphor often used to describe a spike in the aging American population due to advances in medicine keeping people alive longer, as well as the greying of the Baby Boomer generation. Dr. Dilip Jeste, director of the Center on Healthy Aging at the University of California, San Diego, says that with this great grey wave, there&#x2019;s also the notion that older people will drain society with cost. "That&#x2019;s wrong. To me, old age is the fountain of wisdom; and the older people can contribute to society by transferring their wisdom to the younger generation. And I strongly believe that intergenerational activities are critical for successful aging because it is mutually beneficial. If we keep older people happier and engaged and involved in intergenerational activities, they will be healthier. If they&#x2019;re healthier, the health care cost is going to go down. So, we need to take good care of older people &#x2013; not out of compassion, but even from the point of view of economics, it saves us money."</description>

    <description>We interview a lot of researchers at the University of California, and one thing we hear about a lot is how beneficial it is for researchers to have students and interdisciplinary faculty at their fingertips. Biomedical scientist Gabriela Loots of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is no exception. Loots and her team found that a specific protein inhibits prostate cancer metastasis to the bone and says collaboration has been crucial in this work. "Around 2005, I started interacting with scientists at UC Merced and then I was interested in having a more formal affiliation with them in the Qualitative Biology Program. And so now I have graduate students who will rotate in my laboratory. And it&#x2019;s been working out great. So with the UC Davis Cancer Center, we have started interacting with some of the scientists there because of my interest in prostate cancer and now we&#x2019;re growing to other types of cancer research. And so we just started communicating with some of these scientists and we started collaborating." Their current research may lead to better prevention and treatment of aggressive forms of prostate cancer that spread to the bone.</description>

    <description>What really makes you happy or sad? According to Psychologist Iris Mauss of the University of California, Berkeley it is not so much about what&#x2019;s happening to you, but how you perceive the situations you are in. "How you relate to your own emotions, transforms the experiences that you have in some way." Mauss says the right way of thinking is the best way to protect yourself from moodiness, depression and anxiety. "If you accept your negative emotions as just a natural response, you are going to pay less attention to them and so while they exist and happen, they blow over pretty quickly. Another idea is if you accept the negative emotions you have, you basically don&#x2019;t punish yourself for feeling them and you avoid piling negativity upon negativity." Or if you simply don&#x2019;t chalk up your misfortunes to &#x201C;bad luck,&#x201D; this alone might cheer you up.</description>

    <description>It&#x2019;s time for the weekly roundup again. This week we spoke to a research scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory about how the amount of carbon dioxide that trees and plants have been grabbing from the atmosphere has increased over the years. Trevor Keenan says explains that plants have been &#x2018;inhaling&#x2019; more carbon dioxide through photosynthesis but they did not &#x2018;exhale&#x2019; more CO2 into the atmosphere through respiration. "So, this is called the CO2 fertilization effect, a well-known and widely-studied effect of how CO2 affects plants. During the last decade, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere continue to go up and this means that plants have more CO2 to use." And while this sounds like a good thing, Keenan warns that the threat of global warming is still there and this study underscores the value of protecting vital ecosystems. Next up, we find out that economic hardship can actually shape the way our brain works. Psychiatrist Kristine Yaffe of UC San Francisco explains that poverty affects cognitive function due to a concept called &#x2018;cognitive reserve&#x2019;. "And what that means is the more you grow your brain, the more you have education, the more it is simulated, the more complex your occupation is, the more complex your lifestyle activities are, your leisure activities." By understanding this, Yaffe hopes researchers can help prevent cognitive diseases later in life. And speaking of issues later in life, we really enjoyed our time with Dilip Jeste, a geriatric neuropsychiatrist at UC San Diego. He told us that the mental health of older adults actually improves with time, even in those with physical ailments. "We wanted to look at, not only the physical illnesses and cognitive problem, but also the positive characteristics. Things like resilience, optimism, social engagement, compassion, wisdom. So, we got a much more comprehensive understanding of aging that many of the studies do." To hear these episodes and more like them, subscribe to Science Today on iTunes.

    <description>One way to improve the nation&#x2019;s healthcare quality is to start effectively analyzing medical data using modern technology in clinics and hospitals. This is something that the industry hasn&#x2019;t done just yet, according to pediatric surgeon Hanmin Lee of the University of California, San Francisco. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t have one unified electronic medical record system. So it is hard to aggregate big data, but I believe we are on the cusp of that. &#x201D; Lee says diagnostic methods should be improved too. &#x201C;For instance, the data that the nurses collect to determine whether a patient is in a good or bad nutritional status is they record how much food is left on a patient&#x2019;s tray when it gets taken away by the support staff. So that&#x2019;s the best metric to ascertain whether or not patients are at high or low risk of decubitus ulcers. To currently use this, it borders on the preposterous.&#x201D; According to Lee, with a modernized approach to data and technology, doctors could better understand diseases and bring precision medicine to fruition.</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today, we learned something that many of you probably already know &#x2013; and that&#x2019;s how curiosity is often the main ingredient in scientific discovery. So many of the researchers we interview every week, often make breakthroughs by simply wondering about the world around them or asking different questions. In the case of nutrition researcher Angela Zivkovic at UC Davis, in her case it was a picture that prompted her to a discovery that the composition of sugars coating HDL particles in body may be a biomarker for disease. "It was an electron micrograph of the inside of an arterial wall and it was hairy looking, right? And it&#x2019;s because the endothelial cells that line the inside of your arteries are actually covered with these sugars. They&#x2019;re kind of like these structures that help make sure certain things get through and certain things don&#x2019;t get through from the bloodstream. And when I saw that picture I realized, well if your cells that these HDL particles have to kind of interact with are covered with sugars, then the HDL must be covered with sugars, too." And at UCSF, environmental health scientist Tracey Woodruff wanted to understand how chemicals in the environment intersect with health disparities. "For example, African American women have higher rates of adverse birth outcomes like preterm birth and low birthweight. Is it because one of the reasons of this health disparity is because there is some type of environmental factors that are also combining with the factors that are due to their circumstances, that put their pregnancy more at risk?" And additional stressors like discrimination or domestic violence are exacerbated by environmental factors like air pollution or cigarette smoke. So by asking this question and digging further, Woodruff hopes their findings may lead to the implementation of better environmental policies, especially in impoverished areas that often get exposed to chemicals. And these are just two University of California researchers who are trying to make a difference in the world. Subscribe to Science Today on iTunes or follow us on Soundcloud to hear about others.

    <description>This week on Science Today, we learned that the treatment of concussions has not been very well-defined, so radiologist Pratik Mukherjee at UC San Francisco is calling for more studies and a better understanding from doctors and researchers. "Some people recommend cognitive rest, where you stay away from doing anything intense; physical or mental activities; stay away from bright lights and loud noises for several days. Some of the more recent studies are saying, well, maybe that&#x2019;s not quite the right approach. People should try to return to their regular activities as soon as they can and stay active." We also learned while at UCSF that younger women are more likely to develop breast cancer if their breasts are dense. That means, there is more supportive tissue, rather than fatty tissue around the ducts. Breast cancer researcher Karla Kerlikowske told us that cancer rarely develops in fat and older women have a smaller risk of developing the disease because compared to younger women, they tend to have fatty breast tissue. "In older women, maybe a third of women that have dense breasts; when in premenopausal women, it is about two-thirds of women who have dense breasts. It is a more common risk factor, but it is also a strong risk factor." Well, that&#x2019;s all for now - but if you want to learn more about the University of California&#x2019;s efforts to mitigate climate change, you should check out climate.universityofcaliornia.edu - there&#x2019;s a lot to look at there!

    <description>The preschool system in America needs a lot of improvement. That&#x2019;s according to Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley. &#x201C;Preschool in America is about 50 years behind preschool in Europe, preschools in Scandinavian countries like Finland or Sweden. Even UK, which has a more conservative political history. These countries fund high quality pre-K for low income and true middle class families. They might not subsidize pre-K for wealthy families, but for the true middle-class quality pre-K is pretty well funded.&#x201D; America&#x2019;s approach is quite different. &#x201C;In many parts of the country the lowest quality pre-K are in true middle class communities, communities where families earn $52-53,000 a year. They don&#x2019;t qualify for government subsidies, but they can&#x2019;t pay high fees." So Fuller says very often low qualified pre-K teachers get hired. &#x201C;And it is really the middle class of America that&#x2019;s hurt the most."</description>

    <description>Globally, head injuries are a growing problem. In the U.S., more than 3 million Americans are admitted to emergency rooms every year after suffering a concussion. &#x201C;And concussion rates are rising in other countries, too. Especially in developing countries like China and India because they have many more motor vehicles on the roads now. &#x201C; That&#x2019;s radiologist Pratik Mukherjee of the University of California, San Francisco, He says this topic doesn&#x2019;t get a lot of media attention, unless athletes or military personal suffer head trauma. Even injured people normally ignore minor concussions, usually after they fall down or get into a car accident. But fortunately, there is increasing awareness about concussions. &#x201C;You know, having your bell rung, is not necessarily a benign condition and is not something you just walk off like people used to say.&#x201D; Undetected and untreated concussions can lead to continued problems like headaches, insomnia, depression, or even to dementia and premature death.

    <description>When it comes to the neuroscience of pain, toxins are a surprisingly handy research tool. Much of the nervous system uses what&#x2019;s called sodium channels to carry signals to your brain. But if a pathway is problematic, the sheer diversity of these channels can make treatment a challenge. In a recent step towards more selective pain drugs, researcher Jeremiah Steen of the University of California, San Francisco found that a toxin in tarantula venom attaches to one type of these sodium channels that&#x2019;s associated with sharp, biting pain. "These sodium channels are expressed all over the nervous system, and they have very subtle differences. And so, when you&#x2019;re trying to design a drug, it&#x2019;s just very hard to find a molecule that will recognize one of these subtypes and not others." And so, getting back to the tarantula toxin&#x2026; "What was very interesting and serendipitous for us was that it was selective for a certain subtype of sodium channel. And that&#x2019;s really what allowed us to study that sodium channel using the toxin." </description>

    <description>It&#x2019;s been 35 years since the first fetal surgery was performed by Dr. Michael Harrison of the University of California, San Francisco . And now engineers at the University of California, Berkeley are teaming up with Harrison to develop a fetal surgery glue that&#x2019;s inspired by mussels &#x2013; yes, the edible ocean dwellers. UC Berkeley engineer Phillip Messersmith says they&#x2019;re synthesizing a glue that&#x2019;s based on the tough adhesive that mussels produce to stick to rocks. "The idea that we could borrow ideas from the mussel and use them in a synthetic material is something that we embraced. And so if you want to do that, you have to at least have some basic level of understanding of how this glue works in nature." Mussels secrete a series of protein threads to anchor to a wet surface, so Messersmith and his team have created synthetic polymers that mimic the glue. The hope is that this glue may alleviate current risks of rupturing the protective membrane of the amniotic sac. "Now we&#x2019;re embarking on a four-year project for fetal surgery glues." </description>

    <description>Believe it or not, neuroscience is still considered a relatively new field of medical research. That&#x2019;s because there&#x2019;s still a lot of the unknown about our brain. For instance, how do brain cells wire up and function? To answer this question, John Ngai, a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, is creating a brain catalogue or - as researchers call it &#x2013; an atlas. &#x201C;So the idea behind this brain atlas project is to identify all the cell types in the mouse brain as a model for understanding the human brain and then to understand their physiological properties, how they connect with other so this can be used as a basis for understanding not only normal function of the brain, but also how diseases might progress and eventually how you might treat those diseases in human neurological conditions." The effort is part of the federal government&#x2019;s BRAIN Initiative, which launched four years ago. Its ultimate goal is to understand brain circuits well enough to devise new therapies for diseases of the human brain and nervous system.</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. Our bodies naturally produce byproducts that may not be too healthy for us but are usually adept at maintaining balance. So, when a medication leads to an excess of molecules that are harsh on the body, we should probably be concerned, right? Researcher Aldrin Gomes of the University of California, Davis says common pain relievers known as NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, do just this. "These NSAIDs were actually inducing something called reactive oxygen species &#x2013; stuff that our body produces naturally but in small amounts." Aldrin explains how these molecules can stress heart cells and are even linked to disease. We then go from the heart to the skeletal system and hear from biomedical scientist Gabriela Loots of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. She's investigating the tendency of aggressive cancers to metastasize to bone. "There are certain molecules, for examples, that once secreted by the bone they seem to create this environment that&#x2019;s very attractive to the cancer cells to go there and to grow." So Loots and her team are now trying to understand how to manipulate the environment of a tumor to prevent this spread. Also on the cellular scale, UCSF researcher Jeremiah Osteen is studying how a specific toxin in tarantula venom can very selectively target what&#x2019;s known as a sodium channel, which much of the nervous system uses to carry signals to your brain." "What was very interesting and serendipitous for us was that it was selective for a certain subtype of sodium channel. And that&#x2019;s really what allowed us to study that sodium channel using the toxin." Osteen says this toxin will help give insight into a particular pain pathway.

    <description>Obsessive thoughts, nightmares and alcohol addiction are often associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. In a quest to ease these symptoms, neuroscientist Jennifer Mitchell, of the University of California, San Francisco, is testing the power of oxytocin, the so-called &#x201C;love hormone&#x201D;. This could be a new therapy for combat veterans and active military personnel. &#x201C;We are interested in general in developing novel therapeutics for alcohol use disorder and co-morbid PTSD, because it is a population that is very difficult to treat and there are not a lot of treatments currently prescribed for. One of the therapeutics that we are looking at is oxytocin.&#x201D; This 'love hormone', also called the &#x201C;moral molecule&#x201D; and the &#x201C;cuddle chemical&#x201D; - makes people feel bonded. It helps us manage stress and anxiety, be more social, trusting and empathetic. &#x201C;Perhaps the oxytocin could ameliorate some of the signs and symptoms of the alcohol use disorder, the craving and some of the emotional reactivity and the signs and symptoms of PTSD as well.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>In recent months, we&#x2019;ve learned a lot about mosquitoes due to the spread of the Zika virus. For one thing, they have an incredibly sensitive olfactory system. Entomologist Anandsankar Ray of the University of California, Riverside explains that when we exhale carbon dioxide, it gets carried downwind in the shape of plumes that can travel quite a distance. "And the mosquito, when it comes across one such plume, it starts flying upwind tracking these plumes moving closer and closer towards us. And when it&#x2019;s really close, it picks up on other odors that we emit from our skin and recognizes that &#x201C;oh, this is a human being that is going to be a source of blood and makes a beeline for us.&#x201D; But there is a crack in their olfactory armor that Ray and his colleagues are taking advantage of; it&#x2019;s so sensitive that they can interfere with the system using simple, natural molecules to disrupt how they hone in on us.</description>

    <description>If you&#x2019;re suffering from a fever or arthritis pain, anti-inflammatories can provide welcome relief. But this might not be entirely true for your heart. Researcher Aldrin Gomes of the University of California, Davis found that the chronic use of the anti-inflammatories known as NSAIDs can actually damage heart cells by producing chemically reactive molecules. "These NSAIDs were actually inducing something called reactive oxygen species, stuff that our body produces naturally but in small amounts." An excess of molecules can prevent the breakdown of harmful proteins that can build up and cause cardiac cell death. While not all NSAIDs may harm heart tissue, Gomes encourages seeking natural alternatives, like turmeric paste or tart cherries. "Part of what we&#x2019;re doing is outreach&#x2013; trying to get the word out to people that they shouldn&#x2019;t be using NSAIDs as a regular treatment unless it&#x2019;s really, absolutely necessary. NSAIDs also has very well-known gastrointestinal problems. So we have to be careful how much we take, when we take it."</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today, caregiving was a theme &#x2013; from helping out dementia patients and those who look after them; to giving rice crops in polluted China the best chances to thrive. And even a story about how a college dining hall&#x2019;s desire to care for the planet, led to an interesting way to cut down on food waste. First, did you know that one in 10 people age 65 and older suffer from dementia? And that the disease takes a toll only on patients, but their caregivers, too. We spoke to psychologist Robert Levenson of UC Berkeley. His new study showed that rates of depression among caregivers are about four times higher than non-caregiving adults in the same age group. And that a depressed caregiver contributes to a faster decline of the loved one with dementia. "If you are being cared for by a quite depressed person, you are going to live, on average, by about 14 months less than if you are being cared for by a person who is not very depressed. This is a significant shortening of life." And at UC Davis, we met with Colin Carter, a professor of agricultural and resource economics. He cares about how surface ozone impacts rice plant production in polluted China. "There&#x2019;s a critical period during the growing season where you have a day of extremely high ozone that it can reduce the yield up to 1 percent &#x2013; just one day. So we measured across the country that yields could be reduced by two percent or more." That may not sound like a lot, but it is when you consider the fact that China is the world&#x2019;s largest producer of rice and the world&#x2019;s largest importer. So, Carter is hoping their findings will help China enact regulatory polices to alleviate damaging effects of ozone pollution on rice yields. Finally, in an effort to reduce food waste and create a more sustainable approach to dining, Jill Horst at UC Santa Barbara describes how they dealt with all the half-eaten apples they were noticing in their tray returns. "And it wasn&#x2019;t because the apple wasn&#x2019;t good, but the apple was so large. So we decided, well, they have different sized apples, so why don&#x2019;t we take a look at what would be the best size apple that somebody could consume without any waste?" While students at first questioned these dinky apples and wondered why they had them, Horst put up a display of all the wasted, larger apples to show students. It worked and led to much less waste in the dining hall &#x2013; meaning much less waste in the landfill.

    <description>Hey there! It&#x2019;s been another action-packed week, full of interesting research from around the University of California system. First up, did you know our brains take more time to develop than previously thought? Neither did researcher; they thought most of the development that happened after birth was simply fine-tuning. But Neurologist Mercedes Parades of UC San Francisco discovered that our brains are still developing right after birth &#x2013; with young neurons moving to the frontal lobe of the brain where they become functional. "And this is something new, both in terms of how long brain development is still ongoing, but also the fact that this is a period right around the time of birth and there is a lot of pathological changes that can happen and the brain is vulnerable." This new understanding of what&#x2019;s happening in newborn babies' brains will help scientists get a better sense of what triggers developmental disorders. Next, we go from babies to Baby Boomers. They make up the &#x2018;silver tsunami&#x2019;, a metaphor used to describe a spike in the aging American population, mostly due to the greying of the Baby Boomer generation. Dr. Dilip Jeste of UC San Diego says there&#x2019;s some misapprehension about this great grey wave coming towards us. Specifically, that they&#x2019;re a drag and are just going to bog us down with costs. "That&#x2019;s wrong. I strongly believe that intergenerational activities are critical for successful aging because it&#x2019;s mutually beneficial. If we keep older people happier and engaged and involved in intergenerational activities, they will be healthier. If they&#x2019;re healthier, the health care cost is going to go down. So, we need to take good care of older people &#x2013; not out of compassion, but even from the point of view of economics; it saves us money." And Jeste adds, older people can transfer a lot of wisdom to the younger generation. To hear these and other stories, subscribe to Science Today on iTunes or check out on Facebook.

    <description>There's been a lot of interest in how media is affecting the brain during adolescence, but there still isn&#x2019;t enough data for researchers to determine whether or not it&#x2019;s beneficial or harmful to the teenage brain. UCLA&#x2019;s Adriana Galv&#xE1;n is an expert on adolescent brain development and says that&#x2019;s in part because the media itself is still relatively new. "And so we don&#x2019;t have the long-term data over many years to determine what it&#x2019;s doing to the brain, but certainly we do know that it&#x2019;s another form of teenagers having more social interactions, having great reactions emotionally to things that they see on media or read about, but we don&#x2019;t really know what it&#x2019;s doing to their brain yet &#x2013; but stay tuned, a lot of people are doing that research." Adolescent neurobiology generates so much interest because the teen years are such a key period of developmental transition. UCLA is even leading the UC system's multi-campus, multi-disciplinary Consortium on the Developmental Science of Adolescence.</description>

    <description>Could it be that time is expanding because space is expanding? That&#x2019;s a new theory of University of California, Berkeley physicist Richard Muller. And there&#x2019;s actually a way to test this hypothesis using LIGO, the world&#x2019;s largest gravitational wave observatory. LIGO recently saw two black holes, 30 times the mass of the sun, coming together in a collapsing event and making one huge, big black hole. This, Muller explains, makes gravitational waves and we can see these waves coming. "When this happens, you are locally creating millions of square miles of new space. And so if you&#x2019;re creating new space, you&#x2019;re creating new time and I calculated how much this was and it turns out to be a thousandth of a second." So if Muller and his collaborators at CalTech are right, when two black holes merge and create new space, they should also create new time and that would delay the gravitational wave signal that LIGO observes from Earth. "I&#x2019;m looking forward to getting a phone call from them saying, either Gee, Rich, your theory is wrong, sorry. Or congratulations, you&#x2019;ve just explained the flow of time.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Will marijuana become a "new version" of cigarettes? Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, says public health experts need to be cautious about the negative effects of cannabis. "The historical situation where tobacco was the gateway to marijuana where kids started with tobacco and then graduated to marijuana, that situation&#x2019;s now totally reversed. Kids think marijuana is harmless and even good for you. They start with marijuana and then move on to tobacco. So the marijuana and tobacco epidemics are really inextricably tied to each other." Glantz suggests that a better way to approach legalization of marijuana would be to focus on minimizing cannabis use and prioritizing public health over commercial interests and tax revenue generation.</description>

    <description>Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have started an ambitious project to build a brain atlas. According to neuroscientist John Ngai, the goal is to create a catalogue of different brain cells. "The human brain contains about 80 billion neurons, nerve cells. And of the neurons we suspect there could be hundreds, if not thousands of types of distinct types of those cells, but until recently we really haven&#x2019;t had a way of categorizing or classifying those cells in a quantitative or rational way." But why do researchers need this mapping tool? "In order to understand how the brain processes information and gives raise to things like cognition, emotion, we really need to know what different parts are." Ngai also hopes this atlas will help scientists understand brain cells&#x2019; connections well enough to launch new therapies for treating cognitive and neurological diseases.</description>

    <description>It looks like octopuses may be able to detect color thanks to their bizarrely shaped pupils. Cephalopods, as colorful as they are, have long been thought to be colorblind. But graduate student Alexander Stubbs of the University of California, Berkeley has a new theory explaining how color vision may still be possible through the chromatic blurring of objects. "Octopus, squid, and cuttlefish are widely regarded as some of the must colorfully dynamic creatures on planet Earth. But this was somewhat of a mystery because they had no normally known mechanism of sensing the wavelength of light or the color of objects. And what we showed in this paper is that their fairly unique pupil shape &#x2013; with a U-shaped pupil in cuttlefish and squid or a dumbbell shaped bar pupil in octopus &#x2013; means that they blur their image, but in a color dependent way. So they&#x2019;re effectively able to focus through colors, rather than focusing beyond a certain distance." </description>

    <description>Over the past few decades, the amount of carbon dioxide that trees and plants have been grabbing from the atmosphere has increased. Trevor Keenan, a research scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, found that plants have been &#x201C;inhaling&#x201D; more carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. But they did not "exhale" more CO2 into the atmosphere through respiration. "So this is called the CO2 fertilization effect - a widely known effect of how CO2 affects plants. During the last few decades, the concentration of the CO2 in the atmosphere continue to go up and this means plants have more CO2 to use.&#x201D; This sounds like good news since less carbon dioxide is accumulated in the atmosphere, but Keenan says the threat of global warming is still there. "And so even though the plants are helping us out, whether they will continue doing it is a big question. CO2 in the atmosphere is still going up and so climate change is getting more and more likely to be more extreme." In the meantime, this research underscores the importance of protecting vital ecosystems.</description>

    <description>Your computer network at home or at the office probably has a list of things on them, like handsets, phones, tablets. Imagine now how that may look scaled up at a large government agency like the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. There, administrators have to view an entire network system from a vantage point of security. Computer scientist Domingo Colon says because there are needs that are lacking in some commercial offerings, they developed their own tool to watch and probe a network. It&#x2019;s called Network Mapping Systems or NeMS. "One of the things that our tool does is it provides a visualization of exactly what you have just done to your environment and so it helps reduce the complexity by providing a way for you to actually understand and visualize your changes. Not just the configuration information, not just one piece of data, but really to look at the entire organization, how it&#x2019;s behaving, how it&#x2019;s structured. It&#x2019;s been used inside the government and now with the work of commercializing the product, we&#x2019;re looking to get it out there to help the private sector because we all have the same threats facing us and cyber security is extremely costly when things go wrong."</description>

    <description>As the years fly by, take heart &#x2013; a University of California, San Diego study has found that despite physical ailments, older adults seem to consistently get happier over time. Dr. Dilip Jeste says the conventional wisdom about aging is it&#x2019;s all gloom and doom. "We associate aging with diseases, disabilities, degeneration, dementia and depression. All of the negative things, 2:14 which I find so insulting and degrading, and also it is wrong." Jeste&#x2019;s study focused on physical health, cognitive function and other measures of mental health in over 1500 adults, ages 21 to 103 years. "We wanted to look at, not only the physical illnesses and cognitive problem, but also the positive characteristics &#x2013; things like resilience, optimism, social engagement, compassion, wisdom. So, we got a much more comprehensive understanding of aging than many of the studies do."</description>

    <description>There may soon be a new way to treat multiple sclerosis, a debilitating autoimmune disease. Neurologist Bruce Cree of the University of California, San Francisco has been testing an experimental medication called ocrelizumab, which suppresses the immune system&#x2019;s B-cells, which are a class of white blood cells. "And we think that B cells potentially play a very important role in multiple sclerosis.&#x201D; Most existing MS drugs target T-cells and there are more side effects. &#x201C;Because when you just target B cells without affecting T-cells, you have less of a potential for adverse events due to broad spectrum immune suppression. I think that&#x2019;s the key distinction. I think the big advantage for B cell directed therapy in multiple sclerosis is going to be the ability to have highly effective treatment with a better tolerated and improved side effect profile for our patients."

    <description>People are considered adults when they turn eighteen, but from a neuroscience perspective, the brain keeps growing and developing beyond that age. Dr. Adriana Galv&#xE1;n, director of the UCLA Developmental Neuroscience Lab, explains that current literature suggests it's around age 25 that the brain finishes the period of adolescence. "But the majority of what we call 'plasticity' or sensitivity to the environment, changes around the mid-20s and so that means that although the brain can keep changing in response to new experiences or learning something new, the majority of that development has ended." One of Galv&#xE1;n's studies found that in comparison to adults, the adolescent brain is more excited by positive feedback. "And so this is good evidence for us that there is something very unique about the reward system in the adolescent brain that is distinct from that of childhood as well." And since the reward center of the brain is linked to learning, understanding these differences may have broader implications in the classroom and beyond.</description>

    <description>The brain is a mysterious organ, but it might not be as unpredictable as scientists once thought. Alexander Huth of the University of California, Berkeley recently ran an experiment measuring the brain activity of subjects while they listened to podcasts. Huth expected the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for some higher-order functions like personality and decision making, to register words in a mish mash of locations. Instead, the brain region seemed to respond in a very structured manner, displaying distinct patches of activity for similar words. "One thing I was honestly surprised by was the degree of involvement in the prefrontal context. Sure, neuroscientists see things in the prefrontal cortex, but usually in specific areas that are very tied to language production and language comprehension. We saw responses everywhere. We also saw organization everywhere." His next steps will involve building more of these connections. "One thing I really want to do now is look at the relationship between the visual representations and the linguistic representations, seeing a thing and hearing the word for that thing. So sort of, where do these two things collide?" </description>

    <description>We&#x2019;ve all seen astronauts floating around weightless in the space shuttle and while it seems like fun, prolonged exposure to microgravity results in bone loss and muscle atrophy. Matthew Coleman, a senior research scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory says there are other concerns, too. "You also have different levels of ionizing radiation that you&#x2019;re being bombarded by in space because here on Earth, we&#x2019;re protected because we have an atmosphere. But when we go beyond the atmosphere and beyond where the Space Station is now, there&#x2019;s going to be much higher levels of radiation." Coleman is part of a team of researchers working on a single, handheld diagnostic device that may contain a host of biomarkers, including some for radiation sensitivity. "And so if you&#x2019;re somebody that&#x2019;s more sensitive to radiation exposure, you may not want to go out on too many spacewalks and you may need to limit those sorts of activities and therefore, somebody else will have to complete that mission requirement."</description>

    <description>Hey there, in today&#x2019;s weekly roundup, we find out how a college dining hall makes a dent when it comes to climate change. Jill Horst, the director of residential dining services at the University of California, Santa Barbara, says they stopped using trays in their dining hall. "It just overall was this big, huge impact. The food waste per person, per tray, reduced by 50 percent. That&#x2019;s a lot! That&#x2019;s a significant impact to help with not only the food waste, but food cost." Psychology was definitely at play here, as people naturally want to load up a large tray with food, so by removing it, people were carrying their food to the table and their portions adjusted accordingly. Next, as we&#x2019;re about to hit the triple digits this weekend in parts of the Bay Area, we spoke to Ronnen Levinson, a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who has been studying how lighter, more reflective pavements lessen the phenomenon called &#x2018;urban heat islands&#x2019;, where dark-colored roads and buildings bring a city&#x2019;s air temperature up. But in a new study, Levinson found there are some trade-offs. "We found that in many cases, switching to a more reflective pavement technology for example, a light grey cement concrete pavement in place of a black asphalt concrete pavement, requires much more energy and carbon." So Levinson suggests that city officials bear this in mind when choosing pavements. Meanwhile, at another national lab &#x2013; this time, the Livermore Lab &#x2013; computer scientists describe a tool they&#x2019;ve developed to improve the computer network security of government agencies, along with state and local agencies. Domingo Colon says their network mapping system called NeMS, gives network managers a comprehensive view of their computer network environments. "So there are a lot of tools out there that provide different vantage points of network security, but what we needed was something a lot more specific that told us behaviorially what&#x2019;s happening on our network, and also structurally, how is the composition of our network put together at any point in time. These things provide what&#x2019;s called &#x201C;attack surface&#x201D; for someone from the external world and what you want, as an enterprise, is to reduce that surface."

    <description>For decades, researchers have been struggling to understand why some children develop asthma and allergies and some don't. Susan Lynch, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Francisco, has found that the microbes in a human gut may have some answers. While sampling newborn babies' stools, Lynch has discovered the same microbes that asthmatic adults have. "And what we found is the children with highest risk type of microbiota they lacked a large range of bacteria and they include key organisms that we consider as biomarkers of healthy individuals. What we also found is that specific group that was at highest risk had quite a large expansion of two different types of fungi - rhodotorula and candida, and we know candida can be pro-allergic." Lynch says that further studies of these microbes' effect on immune function may help prevent asthma and allergies.</description>

    <description>If you have a good stereovision, you could be a perfect fit for jobs that require action, speed and precision, according to neuroscientist of the University of California, Berkeley, Adrian Chopin. &#x201C;If you are part of a baseball team or a basketball team, it will be easier if you had stereovision. If you already have a good stereovision but that you want to be better, one way to go there is to be a military person." But in his study Chopin mainly targets people with a condition called amblyopia &#x2013; when vision in one of the eyes is reduced. This often leads to a loss of stereoscopic vision. &#x201C;When we train people to have a better stereoscopic vision, we put them in front of a computer. We project on a screen lines of different depth. The task is just to say do you see the line in front or behind the other line, for example." Chopin says, over 10 percent of people around the world are stereo-impaired, but the rest of us see the world in 3-dimensions and can benefit from improved stereoscopic vision.</description>

    <description>Doctors at the University of California, San Francisco have observed that colonoscopies performed with CT scans and viewed as holograms are just as accurate as the traditional exam. But can this virtual holography be used for other purposes? Physician Judy Yee says the technology could be applied to other parts of the body, from the brain to the liver. It could also help surgeons prepare for procedures. "Pre-surgical planning is going to be, I think, a large part of this. It will allow surgeons to get a sense of the size of lesions, the proximity to key structures like vessels and to potentially practice the approach to a tumor, for example. What&#x2019;s the best and safest approach to a tumor? And that can be performed really, any part of the body." The goal is to make the images as easy to interpret and precise as possible. "This is extremely new. We are in the validation phase now for looking at accuracy, and after that we should see increasing use of the product." </description>

    <description>Can exclusively breastfeeding a baby lengthen their telomeres, or the protective caps on their DNA? Shorter telomeres are linked to a higher risk of health problems like heart disease and diabetes later on in life. While studying obesity in a group of Latino children, epidemiologist Janet Wojcicki of the University of California, San Francisco noticed a connection between telomere length and breastfeeding habits. "Exclusive breastfeeding at 4 to 6 weeks of age and breastfeeding at 6 months were associated with longer telomere length in children at 4 to 5 years of age." Telomeres protect our cells as they divide and help prevent chronic disease. This is the first study linking breastfeeding and diet to early telomere shortening, and may help researchers predict and work to prevent conditions early in a child&#x2019;s life. "This can be seen as in the realm of precision medicine &#x2013; how do we use this particular tool, maybe, to help the risk prediction for future development of metabolic disease?" </description>

    <description>Hopefully you made it through the holiday season safely and in good health. According to Gregory Marcus, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, there is something called &#x2018;holiday heart syndrome&#x2019; &#x2013; basically, a link between excessive alcohol consumption and atrial fibrillation. "Those who drank more alcohol tended to have larger left atrium, those with large atrium are more prone to atrial fibrillation. Atiral fibrillation is the most common abnormal heart rhythm that we see, it affects millions of individuals and it is a very important cause of stroke." But there&#x2019;s evidence that has shown moderate consumption of alcohol could help prevent heart attacks. Such conflicting studies confuse patients, who often ask their doctor ... "Should I drink alcohol, should I avoid alcohol, and frankly - we still really don't know. Different patients respond differently to alcohol." One thing is clear to all researchers: while occasional drinking can lift your holiday spirit and will do no harm, excessive alcohol consumption is never good for anyone.</description>

    <description>If you had to guess who has the sharpest vision, you may think of a surgeon or a dentist, but probably not a dressmaker. But according to University of California, Berkeley neuroscientist Adrian Chopin, it&#x2019;s dressmakers who have the best stereoscopic vision. &#x201C;In general we see in 3D. In our mind the environment is in 3D. However, it does not necessarily feel in 3D. So that&#x2019;s feeling of depth that we call stereopsis is very strongly coming from stereoscopic vision, which means a difference of viewpoint between these two eyes.&#x201D; But how do we use it in our daily lives? &#x201C;It is very important in grasping objects, that&#x2019;s because you need high precision when you put your finger on an object, not to crash it or not to miss it. We also need it for driving, especially when you are at night. Chopin and his team are working on developing tools, like computer games, that could help people with sight disorders to improve their stereoscopic vision skills.</description>

    <description>Pregnant women exposed to social stress and environmental chemicals, have a higher risk of prenatal developmental problems and low-birth-weight babies. Study leader Tracey Woodruff, an environmental health scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, says the key here is the combined effect of the risk factors. &#x201C;Our study was evaluating the literature to understand what the combined effects were of being exposed to environmental chemicals and stresses that people may experience during life. Stresses that are due to things like living in poor living circumstances, issue that might be due to discrimination like racism, etc. or poverty." Babies born to mothers exposed to these hardships are at higher risk of developing multiple diseases in childhood and having cardiovascular problems and diabetes in adulthood. &#x201C;We have to do a better job of figuring out how do these varies factors that influence somebody&#x2019;s health work together rather than just studying them separately, because they might be in combination more important.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Have you ever overheard people talking about a major plot twist in a movie and end up running out of the room to avoid hearing a spoiler? Well, psychologist Nicholas Christenfeld of the University of California, San Diego says you may want to stick around next time. He led a study in which participants were divided into two groups &#x2013; one read short stories and rated how well they liked them at the end, and the other group read stories that were &#x201C;spoiled&#x201D; by having the endings given away. "The name itself, &#x2018;spoiler&#x2019;, of course suggests that knowing the ending ruins the stories. Do they live up to their name? And what we found, remarkably, was if you spoil stories, they actually enjoy them more. That is, people reading these stories knowing the ending, with the ending completely given away, report greater pleasure reading them." So, what&#x2019;s going on? Christenfeld thinks that spoilers allow people to pay less attention to the plot, and focus more on other, richer aspects of the book, film, or TV show. So you may want to think about this the next time you&#x2019;re about to hear who was the latest casualty on &#x2018;Game of Thrones&#x2019;.</description>

    <description>Colonoscopies are beginning to take a more futuristic form, thanks to radiologist Judy Yee of the University of California, San Francisco. Yee has pioneered the use of CT colonographies to examine the colon using graphical software and images from a CT scan. And the sci-fi part? The scans can also be viewed as holograms. "I have combined my interest in CT colonography with this novel visualization platform to be able to view the data in ways that allow us to pick up certain lesions of the colon easier. I started working on this holographic version because I thought it was a more intuitive way for radiologists and physicians to view anatomy of the body. It pulls the 2D data into what we call true-3D space, so that we could use not only visual cues but manual cues to manipulate the data in 360 degrees. And this is without any additional radiation to the patient." That would cut down a routine colonoscopy from an all-day affair to just a few hours. </description>

    <description>Now that researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have created a 3-D bioprint of living blood vessels, they&#x2019;re moving towards making more tissue-specific vasculature. Bioengineer Monica Moya says she&#x2019;s particularly interested in the brain. "So, we&#x2019;re trying to build the blood-brain barrier, which is the blood vessels in your brain that are responsible for making sure that not just anything gets across, but that&#x2019;s an interesting field because sometimes you do want things to get across." For example, you&#x2019;d want certain drugs to get across that barrier to treat a tumor, but they don&#x2019;t always make it. "And that&#x2019;s actually one of the challenges of people that end up with brain tumors, is that it&#x2019;s hard to treat and it&#x2019;s hard to deliver across the blood-brain barrier and then there&#x2019;s cases where there&#x2019;s stuff that goes across the blood-brain barrier and you want to prevent it from getting across the barrier. So, having a model that you can test is beneficial." Moya and her team have successfully 3D printed structures with living cells and biomaterials using &#x2018;bio-inks&#x2019;, which enabled human capillaries to develop on their own. </description>

    <description>WiFi networks are so ubiquitous and now researchers are working on novel ways to utilize existing signals &#x2013; including figuring out how to optimize heating and cooling systems in homes or buildings. But how? "You need to be able to estimate your occupancy with WiFi signals." That&#x2019;s Yasamin Mostofi, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She runs a research lab there on mobile sensor networks. "That&#x2019;s something that we&#x2019;ve been doing more recently &#x2013; trying to count people with just WiFi signals. Over the whole building, you will have more WiFi links and so then you can extend it to larger areas. So basically the WiFi card is just recording its received power for a period of time and just from that signal, we want to figure out how many people were there, which areas are more crowded? Then the heating and cooling can be optimized accordingly."</description>

    <description>Our genes may be the blueprint that defines us, but environmental factors can also shape the expression of our genes. This process is known as epigenetics, and according to biologist Andrew Dillin of the University of California, Berkeley, a person&#x2019;s metabolism early on in life might be able to activate certain genes and influence longevity. "What we hypothesize is that, during these developmental stages when the metabolic status is registered, there&#x2019;s an epigenetic switch that turns sets of genes on and off." When these genes were turned on, Dillin discovered they extended the lifespan of mice and worms known as nematodes. "And so if you disrupt these epigenetic genes in adulthood, you will erase the signal and then the animals will not live long. And in fact, there are mutations in these genes that are linked to disease in humans. So knowing the basic science behind how these genes work, to epigenetically turn gene sets on and off, we now have the tools to go forward and say, can we find a drug that mimics exactly what we see in our nematode and mouse experiments?" </description>

    <description>Have you been putting off that colonoscopy? The prospect of abstaining from food, drinking a gallon of laxative, then taking a day off work can be a deterrent. But Dr. Judy Yee of the University of California, San Francisco is working towards a less invasive option &#x2013; virtual colonoscopies. These are scans that can be viewed as holograms, allowing doctors to digitally zoom in on parts of the colon and detect issues without the traditional scope. "This is a new test that employs low radiation dose CT scan to acquire data that we can then view on advanced graphical workstations to create 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional views of the colon, to help physicians screen for colorectal cancer." Yee says this technique could be used to image other parts of the body as well. "I think the wonderful part of the virtual holography method is that you can apply it to pretty much any part of the body &#x2013; the brain, the liver, the musculoskeletal system, the heart. And I think that it&#x2019;s really limitless."</description>

    <description>Solar panels have become a popular and efficient way to make electricity, but they are not as good when it comes to storing it. Now, physicist Jeffrey Neaton of the University of California, Berkeley has found a better way to preserve energy. Neaton: &#x201C;What we are doing here is thinking about harnessing that energy and not turning it into electricity, but into fuel, much like gasoline. Fuel is a very compact, energy-dense way of storing of energy&#x201D; Neaton and his colleagues consider photosynthesis as a model to generate fuel and are working on building an artificial leaf that could become a new alternative energy source. &#x201C;This artificial leaf is a set of inorganic materials that one combined does what a leaf does, which is take sunlight and carbon dioxide and generate a fuel, chemical fuel, and oxygen.&#x201D; Neaton says it&#x2019;s still a long way before the artificial leaf become a technology like solar panels, but step-by-step, the idea is turning into reality.</description>

    <description>From a dolphin&#x2019;s mouth to the Atacama desert in Chile, microbes can turn up where scientists least expect them. Using DNA sequencing technology, a team of researchers recently published a new version of biology&#x2019;s tree of life to include many of these elusive microbes. Microbiologist Karthik Anantharaman of the University of California, Berkeley says that these organisms just didn&#x2019;t fit many of biology&#x2019;s definitions. "There&#x2019;s a particular group of bacteria that we are calling the CPRs, or the candidate phyla radiation. And the common thread through all of these organisms is that they&#x2019;re extremely tiny. So if we opened up any microbiology textbook today, they would tell you that the average size of a bacteria is about one micron. But these organisms are smaller than .1 microns. So they&#x2019;re ten times smaller in diameter and a thousand times smaller in volume. And over the last 15 years, we have deciphered that biology can be very unpredictable." </description>

    <description>Many American parents are concerned about preschools becoming too formalized &#x2013; with teachers being too focused on kids&#x2019; academic performance rather than play. But academically-rich activities at a young age is not a bad thing, according to Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley. &#x201C;Preschool educators then feel they gotta have kids ready to do well on tests and there&#x2019;s been a good deal of research showing that in preschools that are just play-focused, a lot of kids spend time wandering around classrooms, a lot of youngsters are in dress-up corners for 40-50 minutes." Fuller says while children have a good time, they don&#x2019;t learn as much as they should at a preschool age. &#x201C;Kids&#x2019; brains are like sponges. They can pick up pre-literacy skills, new vocabulary. They can pick up understanding of math concepts quickly. Our finding pushed the early education establishment to think how can we blend playful activity and move from childrens&#x2019; natural curiosity while at the same time challenging them in cognitive ways to boost their growth, when they are three or four years of age.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Here are some of the stories covered this week on Science Today. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease that can paralyze the brain and spinal cord when the immune system attacks the body. MS affects about 2 million people globally and while there is no cure for the chronic disease, drug regimens and behavioral therapy have allowed people with MS to lead better quality lives. Now, neurologist Bruce Cree of UC San Francisco has been testing a drug in clinical trial that&#x2019;s designed to reduce MS symptoms &#x2013; in fact, Cree found that patients&#x2019; brain inflammation was practically gone. &#x201C;This was very impressive and suggests that we have a highly effective therapy. There is some advantage in medication in terms of tolerability, in terms of efficacy and I think it&#x2019;s going to be a very important new therapy." It&#x2019;s called ocrelizumab and it&#x2019;s currently under review by the FDA. While at UCSF, we also checked in with researchers hoping to improve a powerful gene editing tool called CRISPR, which scientists hope can one day treat genetic disorders. Microbiologist Benjamin Rauch explains that the technology hasn&#x2019;t been precise enough. "CRISPR is not perfect; CRISPR will cut DNA in the wrong place if we give it enough time to do so. You can&#x2019;t edit in the wrong place because it will have some negative effects." So they&#x2019;re working with so-called anti-CRISPR proteins that they found can stop CRISPR before it makes the wrong cut. This is a story we&#x2019;ll definitely keep track of because a safer more accurate CRISPR brings scientists a step closer to developing an effective DNA-editing therapy in the future. And finally, UC San Diego&#x2019;s Catherine Marinac is looking into simple and novel ways to reduce a woman&#x2019;s risk of breast cancer. She found that fasting at least 12 hours overnight may help because women who fasted longer had better control over their blood sugar connections. "We know that it influences inflammation and many of these metabolic factors are related, so you&#x2019;ll typically see abnormal glucose with inflammation. We know it influences some parameters related to Circadian rhythms and Circadian misalignment and all of these things are on the same cascade. So, we don&#x2019;t know the exact mechanism, but that&#x2019;s currently being investigated in animals."

    <description>This is Science Today. Landfills are a large source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. And new research across the state of California has found that its amount in the atmosphere might have been underestimated. Physicist Marc Fisher of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found exactly where excessive methane was coming from and why it was happening. &#x201C;Most of the emissions from landfills are assumed to be gathered by landfill gas mitigation technology and if this technology is not working as effectively as it was designed to be, then more gas could have escaped to the atmosphere&#x201D;. This is especially problematic for the Bay Area, where 50 percent of all the methane comes from landfills, which are ubiquitous in the region. &#x201C;There is now active research identifying how to manage landfills in a way that they emit less&#x201D;. As part of the solution, Fisher recommends improving methods of collecting emissions. For Science Today, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin.</description>

    <description>Over the past two years, the effect of a strong El Nino has dramatically increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, while the amount of fossil fuel emissions produced did not grow. Trevor Keenan, a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has found out exactly why this happened. &#x201C;The effect of El Nino was negative for ecosystems, had a detrimental impact of global droughts and high temperatures caused a net release of carbon dioxide from ecosystems to the atmosphere. &#x201D; Keenan says ecosystems play an important role in regulating the carbon cycle. Sometimes plants release more carbon dioxide, and sometimes they retain more CO2. So, when drastic climate events like El Nino happen, living conditions for plants become more difficult and they release CO2 back into the atmosphere. &#x201C;Hence, speeding up climate change independent of what we do with emissions. So we really need to think about how to protect ecosystems." Especially because scientists are projecting that the earth is accelerating its warming pace.</description>

    <description>Over the years, cancer treatment has improved with minimally-invasive surgeries and more localized chemotherapy techniques. But even if chemotherapy can be localized and delivered directly to a tumor, over half of the drug can pass the tumor and become systemic. "It goes all over your body. The current popular drugs, they are effective, but they are also very toxic. So, they have bad side effects." That&#x2019;s materials scientist Chelsea Chen of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She collaborated with a University of California, San Francisco physician to come up with a device that can filter out the toxins. "What he came up with is that he wants to place this device at the draining vein exiting the tumor, so this device can catch the excessive chemotherapy before it enters the body circulation and this way, it further reduces the systemic toxicity of the drugs. So we designed this device that we call the &#x2018;ChemoFilter&#x2019;." Chen says it may be ready for treatment in a few years.</description>

    <description>In what&#x2019;s being called a genetic &#x2018;Rosetta Stone', researchers at the University of California, San Francisco have discovered molecules that can lead to infantile epilepsy or autism. Specifically, a neuronal protein called NaV1.2 and the gene that produces it, called SCN2A. Both play a crucial role in early brain development, according to the neuroscientist Kevin Bender. &#x201C;One of the central functions of the brain cell is to fire something that is called an action potential, which is a way of transmitting information from one cell to the next. And SCN2A and NaV1.2 are at the heart of that process.&#x201D; Genetic defects that increase neuronal activity as they transmit signals lead to epilepsy, and when this process abnormally slows down, it may cause autism. &#x201C;We now have a roadmap for understanding how different mutations in SCN2A could lead to different diseases and if we understand that, it might uncover new areas for intervention in the future.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Researchers are now able to turn one cell type into another within the body of a mouse. But how can they make sure these changes happen in the right spot? To track the transformation of diseased liver cells into healthy ones, study leader Milad Rezvani of the University of California, San Francisco used a special kind of transgenic, or genetically altered, mouse model. "We focused primarily on one transgenic model that labels this cell type that is the main culprit in liver cirrhosis. So when we reprogrammed this cirrhosis-causing cell type into liver cells, it would maintain this label. We really knew where this cell was coming from." Although the cell transformation materials sent into the mouse ended up in some other places, like a few muscle cells, Rezvani says the amounts were negligible. More importantly, the mice revealed new patches of healthy liver tissue. "That&#x2019;s why mice are extremely important, still, to not only understand disease, but to find new therapeutic approaches." </description>

    <description>Certain medications may be bad for your teeth. In a new study, Peter Rechmann, a professor of dentistry at the University of California, San Francisco, found that patients who take, for example, blood pressure medicine or anti-anxiety drugs are more likely to develop cavities. This is because some of these drugs can cause dry mouth. "What we do with each and every patient, when we figure out a caries risk, we let them spit in a tube and if they produce during two minutes around two millimeters of saliva per minute, that&#x2019;s normal. Those with medication produce much less." When there isn&#x2019;t enough saliva, bacteria can run wild. And while this may damage your teeth with acid. &#x201C;Saliva protects your teeth because it has calcium, phosphate and fluoride in it and it helps to remineralize the tooth. &#x201C; So if you can&#x2019;t get off medication, Rechmann recommends protecting your teeth with fluoride-rich toothpaste, mouthwash with chlorhexidine and chewing gum with xylitol.</description>

    <description>It's a workday, just after lunch. You have a deadline and there's plenty of time left in the day to get the task done. If only you could stop thinking about other things. One thought can lead to your mind just...wandering away. This can't be good, right? You've probably been scolded as a kid for daydreaming in class. But in recent years, neuroscientists and psychologists have found that there are some very redeeming qualities to this mental state - in fact, it could be an essential cognitive skill. Here's an excerpt from an interview conducted with one of those researchers.</description>

    <description>Access to good education might be the key to preventing dementia and other mental problems affecting memory and thinking. This, according to Kristine Yaffe, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco. Yaffe conducted a study looking into how poverty affects our brain and says one of the most obvious connections is that people with higher income usually get a better education than those who struggle financially. &#x201C;Even if you have the same number of years of education, the quality of education may not be as good." And that, Yaffe says, can have a snowball effect in other areas of our lives. &#x201C;Hobbies or access to other kinds of mentally-stimulating activities maybe less. Some of these things cost money, some are neighborhood-affiliated." Yaffe says all of these factors, over time, may weaken our cognitive power. &#x201C;So Ideally we would have better programs to fight poverty and economic hardship.&#x201D; In the meantime, Yaffe says programs improving the quality of education &#x2013; especially for children - are crucial.</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today, we talked about how children who suffer from emotional or physical abuse are at higher risk of developing health problems. Psychiatrist Nicole Bush of the University of California, San Francisco says scientists are unclear about how to reverse the harmful effects, so she is focusing on this in a study. "One of our goals was to look across a variety of systems to see, for example, whether we can improve immune functioning, cortisol stress hormone level, telomere length, DNA methylation profiles." DNA methylation is essential for normal development&#x2013; if the process goes awry, it can be linked to health issues like cancer or cardiovascular disease. So Bush his hoping to improve this and other functions like immune functioning and telomere length using psychotherapy, which studies have proven have been effective for mental and physical health. On the subject of health, we hope you're starting a healthy and happy New Year. This time of year there&#x2019;s a higher risk of what&#x2019;s called &#x2018;holiday heart syndrome&#x2019;. Cardiologist Gregory Marcus, also at UCSF, tells us that it&#x2019;s basically a link between excessive alcohol consumption and atrial fibrillation. "Those who drank more alcohol tended to have larger left atritum, those with large atrium this has long been known, are more prone to atrial fibrillation &#x2013; the most common abnormal heart rhythm that we see. And it is very important because of stroke." So while occasional drinking can lift your holiday spirit and do no harm, Marcus warns that excessive alcohol consumption is never good for anyone. And finally, we stuck around UCSF to better understand the origins or asthma and allergies. Susan Lynch, a gastroenterologist there, may have narrowed it down to one molecule. She and her collaborators at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit found a metabolite, which is a product of metabolism, can trigger these diseases. "There was a specific lipid called 12, 13 diHome and this really stood out to us because this specific lipid is an established biomarker for asthma in adults and we are finding it in the heightened concentration in neonates who go on to develop asthma in childhood." Lynch explains that it actually suppresses the T-cells that are necessary to dampen down allergic inflammation.

    <description>If you or a loved one are putting off that colonoscopy because the thought of the procedure is off-putting, there&#x2019;s a less invasive one that University of California, San Francisco&#x2019;s Dr. Judy Yee helped pioneer. It&#x2019;s called the virtual colonoscopy. "This is a new test that employs low radiation dose CT scan to acquire data that we can then view on advanced graphical workstations to create two-dimensional and three-dimensional views of the colon, to help physicians screen for colorectal cancer." And while we&#x2019;re on the subject of three-dimensional work, we also meet up with lab engineer Chen Zhu of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Zhu was part of a team of scientists at the Livermore Lab and the University of California, Santa Cruz who successfully 3D-printed ultralight supercapacitors using an aerogel made out of the &#x2018;miracle material&#x2019;, graphene. So what does this breakthrough mean for you in the future? Well, how about a highly efficient energy storage system for your smartphone? "If you have iPhone in the future, it can store the energy very quickly and release the energy very fast. So it has very wide applications." Finally, we head back to UCSF to chat with epidemiologist Janet Wojcicki . In an obesity study that focused on Latino children, she found a connection between breastfeeding and telomere length. These are the protective caps on your DNA that are linked to a higher risk of health problems like heart disease and diabetes later in life. "Exclusive breastfeeding at 4 to 6 weeks of age and breastfeeding at six months were associated with longer telomere length in children at 4 to 5 years age." This study may open up a whole new way to predict and prevent conditions early in a child&#x2019;s life.

    <description>Immunotherapy is the future of cancer treatment. Wendell Lim, a molecular scientist of the University of California, San Francisco, says he is very optimistic about its success, but the caveat is - the cure comes at a price. "Currently the therapies use patient's own T cells and modify those. And what's good about that is you won't get an immune reaction against those T cells because they come from you. But that's highly customized and that's part of what makes therapy more expensive." Researchers are looking for ways to make the therapy more affordable so everyone who needs it could pay for it. "One of the things that people in the field are working on hard is to develop more off-the-shelf cells &#x2013; that you might have a cell that comes from either a universal donor, or has been generated from stem cells that is compatible with a certain patient, just the way that an organ would be matched". Lim hopes more funds to tackle this cost savings will be available through the Moonshot Initiative, a project that Vice President Joseph Biden spearheaded to accelerate cancer research.</description>

    <description>Private space tourism is no longer a faraway dream. In fact, Thomas Lang, an imaging scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, is trying to predict what tourists&#x2019; lives would be like in space. Researchers, for example, already have plans for designing commercial space habitats. &#x201C;What happens when you have private space stations? And those stations are geared for commercial activities. You would have people doing manufacturing or research or some other activity in space.&#x201D; The most pressing question for researchers is how to provide space tourists with an adequate training so they could stay in good health. &#x201C;Does it have to be NASA-like training program? Will they cut these health requirements down? What&#x2019;s going to be the right trade off?&#x201D; Lang says, aging happens very quickly in space and can severely affect astronauts&#x2019; bones with lifetime bone structure being lost in just six months. But according to Lang, this could probably be prevented.</description>

    <description>Nature always manages to surprise us, and the diversity of life is no exception. At the University of California, Berkeley, microbiologist Karthik Anantharaman recently helped construct biology&#x2019;s new tree of life, but he also knows what scientists are up against when it comes to documenting every living organism. "Now with regard to finding more and more organisms that we didn&#x2019;t think exist or we didn&#x2019;t have a good understanding, I think it has to do with complexity of the environment. By complexity, I mean how many different organisms live in a particular environment at the same time and can thrive. Now when you look at something like, say, a human environment, it&#x2019;s a relatively simple environment . There aren&#x2019;t a lot of microbes that live on us. When you look at something like water, it&#x2019;s a little more complex, but we can still understand it. And finally, the most complex environments are soils and sediments. There are thousands of microorganisms that are coexisting. There are a lot of extreme environments. But I think slowly but steadily, we are uncovering a lot of it." </description>

    <description>Researchers have discovered a molecule that triggers Listeriosis, a foodborne infection caused by Listeria bacteria. The illness makes hundreds of Americans sick every year and pregnant women are especially vulnerable, since the infection can result in miscarriage and pre-term birth. "The bacterium Listeria is actually ubiquitous. We can find it in the environment, in any kind of food products. And it can cause an occasional disease or it can cause outbreaks. There have been outbreaks associated with cantaloupes, with hotdogs.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s microbiologist Anna BakArdjiev of the University of California, San Francisco. She explains their finding debunk previous theories that a pregnant woman&#x2019;s weakened immune system could trigger the disease. By identifying the culprit as a bacterial protein, Bakardjiev says researchers now have more tools to fight Listeria. "Could we use this protein and vaccinate people with this protein so the bacteria that infected the mother can be eliminated before they get into the placenta if they express the protein?"</description>

    <description>How many times a day does your mind start to wander? Now, be honest; it probably happens a lot. Jonathan Schooler, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara, studies what actually goes on when this occurs. "There are three general categories of things we&#x2019;ve looked at, in terms of mind wandering. The first is its costs. How does mind wandering interfere with peoples&#x2019; abilities in various different situations? And we find that it&#x2019;s quite costly. That if people have mind wandering while reading, that it substantially interferes with their ability to process and remember what they&#x2019;ve read." If that&#x2019;s the case, why do people do it so much? Schooler says one reason is it&#x2019;s helpful for creativity. "We&#x2019;ve been looking at creative scientists and creative writers and looking to see when they have their creative ideas about a third of their ideas happened while they&#x2019;re mind wandering." So, if your mind wandered during this episode, hopefully it&#x2019;s because you just had an &#x2018;ah-ha!&#x2019; moment!</description>

    <description>Some researchers say cows are worse than cars when it comes to global warming because they emit more methane than vehicles produce CO2. The theory was disputed, but it turns out it may not be too far from the truth. Physicist Marc Fisher of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has found that the amount of methane in the atmosphere has been grossly underestimated, and cows are mainly to blame, at least in California. &#x201C;The major source of methane in California as a whole is a very large livestock industry in Central Valley. Cows breath out methane it is because their first stomach is essentially a bioreactor, the manure from cows gets put into wastewater treatment or large treatment lagoons.&#x201D; And Fisher says methane is harder to calculate than carbon dioxide, but it needs to be better regulated &#x2013; as more careful management of methane emissions could help reduce the threat of climate change.</description>

    <description>How do you handle stress? Psychologist Iris Mauss of the University of California, Berkeley wanted to learn how people deal with stressors, so she ran an experiment that involved exposing study participants to uncomfortable situations. &#x201C;We stressed everybody out by having them giving an impromptu speech that we said would be videotaped and later scrutinized by judges. It&#x2019;s an experience that people find very unpleasant. &#x201D; But the way one reacts to a stressful situation like this changes the outcome. &#x201C;We found that people who tend to be more accepting of their negative emotions actually responded with less stress to that experience.&#x201D; According to Mauss, their study refutes previous notions that fewer bad things happen to happier people. It&#x2019;s just that these people often see their negative experiences in a positive light.</description>

    <description>This is Science Today. As drone technology is getting cheaper, they&#x2019;re being used in a host of different ways, including environmental science. Todd Dawson, a molecular biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, is using drones to study how forests get affected by droughts, particularly those that have been affecting the Golden State&#x2019;s iconic sequoia trees. "We see a lot of trees dying in California but we don't really understand why certain places are dying more than others. And now we are starting to get, with this drone images, a more refined picture in areas where is a lot of tree mortality". In a matter of minutes researchers can survey canopies of individual trees and entire forests, as drones fly over and take images with multi-spectral cameras. "That means we are basically keeping our finger on the pulse of the forest change, which we have never been able to do with any of our other tools before." Dawson says the need to save the trees is urgent, as the drought killed over 60 million of them in California last year alone.</description>

    <description>A new technique called exome sequencing is a revolutionary way to look at our DNA. This, according to psychiatrist Stephen Sanders of the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. Basically, it allows researchers to determine the structure of all expressed genes in a genome and recently, it helped UCSF scientists find mutations in a gene that triggers autism. &#x201C;And that was a gene called SCN2A, which stands for Voltage Gated Sodium Channel 2 Alpha. When we saw that result, we were very excited, because we could show that this gene was associated with autism. It was playing an important role in what autism is on a neurological level.&#x201D; Sanders and his colleagues found that people with autism have more S-C-N-2-A mutations, than those without this disease. &#x201C;And before this technology it would have been impossible to have found enough mutations to work this out." Sanders says the next step will be to identify the specific type of the gene mutation and predict the severity of autism.</description>

    <description>Sometimes, breakthroughs in science really do come down to simple curiosity. That was definitely the case when a team of researchers at the University of California, Davis decided to look more closely at the composition of HDL particles in the body. One of HDL's jobs is to transport cholesterol out of cells. Nutrition researcher Angela Zivkovic says it was a picture that prompted her to question if HDL may be covered in glycans, or sugars, and how that may impact the body. "It was an electron micrograph of the inside of an arterial wall and it was hairy looking, right? And it&#x2019;s because the endothelial cells that line the inside of your arteries are actually covered with these sugars. They&#x2019;re kind of like these structures that help make sure certain things get through and certain things don&#x2019;t get through from the bloodstream. And when I saw that picture I realized, well if your cells that these HDL particles have to kind of interact with are covered with sugars, then the HJDL must be covered with sugars, too." Their ultimate finding that these sugars do influence anti-inflammatory proteins in the body could lead to biomarkers for disease. For Science Today, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin.</description>

    <description>If you&#x2019;ve been around awhile, chances are you&#x2019;ve experienced foods that were once touted to be good for you, suddenly becoming the worst thing you could possibly eat. Or at least that&#x2019;s how it feels when there&#x2019;s a lot of media coverage about the latest scientific studies. Take eggs, for example. Over the years, these nutrient-rich orbs have gone from what&#x2019;s for breakfast, to heart-attacks waiting to happen &#x2026; only to be redeemed again as a healthy choice. Of course, moderation is key &#x2013; for anything, but what gives when it comes to such nutritional see-saws? We asked nutrition researcher Angela Zivkovic of the University of California, Davis. "Part of the problem is that we just have natural variability between people, and if we keep trying to find the answer about how a certain diet affects all humans, we're probably never going to find the answer, and we're going to keep having these sort of pendulum swings back and forth. Eggs are good for you, eggs are not good for you, eggs are good for you, eggs are not good for you because every time you get a different population, you'll get a different answer. Really, it's that eggs are good for some people at certain points in time, and eggs are not so good for other people especially at certain points in time. So, you know, we just need to try to figure out, how do we understand how different people respond to different diets at different points? And, again, it's not even just about, how do you respond to eggs? It's today versus three years from now versus 10 years ago. It's very different. People change over time and people are very unique and individual. And it's the overall context, too. That's often something that's really forgotten and missed. It's like, you know, we try to isolate these foods as if we eat them in isolation of other things. Of course, we eat them as complete diets. So let's say I'm on a vegan diet except I eat eggs. The effect of those eggs might be very different than if I eat eggs, but I'm actually on a Paleo-type diet, where I'm also eating a lot of other animal products. So it's really all about context and trying to understand how different people vary and change and respond to these different dietary treatments."</description>

    <description>By the end of the century, climate change will likely cause a decline of wheat and barley yields by 17 to 33 percent. Those were the findings of a new statistical model by the University of California, Davis. Matthew Gammans, a graduate student who worked on the study, says it was based on 65 years of weather records and data from wheat and barley yields in France. "So we started by looking at the relationship between weather and yields and then using some climate change projections, we forecasted that relationship into the future to see what we can expect to happen to these yields." Their work is one of the first flexible statistical models applied to wheat and other cereal crops. "When I say &#x201C;flexible&#x201D;, I mean not just kind of the average temperature or the max temperature, but kind of looking at exposure to every temperature bin, so every potential temperature is included in the analysis and it&#x2019;s the first to apply that to Europe and it&#x2019;s also the first to use that kind of flexible methodology to look at both fall and winter and summer seasons &#x2013; so really trying to understand what&#x2019;s driving these yield changes."</description>

    <description>Marijuana may be a recreational drug for some, but it's a human carcinogen and adds to the risk of heart disease. This, according to Stanton Glanz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Glantz says that cannabis legalization gets so much positive attention from the media, that people forget about how bad it can be for their health. "There should be a large general market media campaign like the media campaign that we run against tobacco." Which means - no cannabis cartoon characters on TV, smoke-free laws and policies that would protect non-users. "And if you look at the way that marijuana is being legalized, it&#x2019;s generally prioritizing business interests and business development over public health. And the proper way to legalize marijuana would be to treat it the way we treat tobacco. We have a large demand reduction program, we have substantial taxes on it and we have a situation where people simply don't want to buy it."</description>

    <description>When you accept your own negative emotions &#x2013; you will likely have a more positive outlook on mood swings than people around you have. That&#x2019;s according to Iris Mauss, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley. &#x201C;If you have an accepting attitude for other people&#x2019;s emotions that tend to make those other people feel better and it helps you respond to their distress in a more constructive way.&#x201D; Mauss says this mindset is invaluable for parents who often deal with their little ones&#x2019; tantrums. &#x201C;Small children have difficulty regulating their emotions because, they are - children." But if their moms and dads are responsive and understanding &#x2013; &#x201C;We believe that over time that might actually help children develop better emotion-regulatory skills. &#x201D; And not only that. Mauss says if you learn how to accept your negative emotions, you&#x2019;ll become a better role model for your kids.</description>

Jennifer Felder, a clinical phycologist at the University of California, San Francisco, is testing out a therapy called cognitive behavioral treatment, which could help expecting mothers fight sleep disorders. &#x201C;There is not currently much research on how best to treat insomnia during pregnancy. We know that cognitive behavioral treatment is effective for insomnia generally, but we don&#x2019;t yet know if it is effective during pregnancy. &#x201C; Felder&#x2019;s study shows that insomnia during pregnancy put women at a higher risk for delivering before 34 weeks of gestation. But according to Felder, doctors don&#x2019;t always see lack of sleep as a problem. &#x201C;Insomnia is often going undetected. It maybe dismissed as part of the normal process of pregnancy.&#x201D; Yet, In the United States one in 10 women deliver their babies preterm, so Felder hopes the insomnia therapy could reduce the rate of preterm birth.</description>

    <description>Doctors may soon be able to cure more cancers with immunotherapy, thanks to new technologies to fight malignant tumors. Wendell Lim, a molecular scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, has designed smart immune T-cells that he says now more than ever have a better chance to defeat the disease. "That&#x2019;s where I think this idea that we really have to attack the problem from two sides. We really have to provide T-cells that can effectively recognize and kill the cancers, as well as ways to counteract immunosuppression." Immunotherapy has shown some success in treating melanoma and lung cancers, but solid tumors - the majority of cancers &#x2013; are still a challenge. &#x201C;The immune system has this kind of potential. I'm pretty optimistic that our understanding and the tools that we have in immunotherapy are just really accelerating at a dramatic pace." The Food and Drug Administration may approve first therapies with engineered T-cells as early as this year.</description>

    <description>Currently, the best known cure for liver cirrhosis is an organ transplant. But in a mouse model, University of California, San Francisco researchers have found a way to transform the diseased cells that drive this progressive scarring into healthy cells. Postdoctoral scholar Milad Rezvani says a big question is whether this technique will prove to be clinically relevant and safe to treat damaged livers in humans. "Liver cirrhosis is still a huge public health burden. Right now we have shown that we can turn this one cirrhosis causing cell type into normal liver cells that function. So the obvious question after a successful mouse in vivo study is, can we do this in human patients?" The technique used a virus to shuttle the desirable genes into diseased cells, and also proved successful on plates of cirrhosis-causing human cells. Rezvani&#x2019;s team is now working to refine this virus so it only targets the liver and avoids infecting other cells in the body. </description>

    <description>Heart disease is the leading cause of death among American women, killing 1 in 3 of them each year. A study by Nisha Parikh, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, showed that the age a woman is when she reaches menopause affects her risk of developing a heart disease. &#x201C;We found that a longer reproductive period duration was actually associated with less of a risk of heart failure. And that was mostly driven by the age of menopause, so that having an early age at menopause was associated with a higher risk of heart failure&#x201D;. But researchers still don&#x2019;t know what causes it and are working on further studies to find the answers. &#x201C;We need to understand what it is about sort of an increased reproductive period that protects a woman from heart failure. Is it something biologic or is it something related to sociodemographic factors or lifestyle choices. I think all of that will be really interesting to explore in the future.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>This is Science Today. Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory might have found what causes cardiomyopathy, a genetic heart disease. According to scientist Diane Dickel, that is an important discovery because doctors don't know what triggers this disease in half the patients. And that may be because researchers were looking for clues in the wrong part of the genome. &#x201C;Only about 3 percent of the genome consists of genes, the other 95 percent of the genome &#x2013; what we call non coding, which just means that it does not encode genes. And it is clear there are important things in that non-coding sequence. &#x201D; So it is the mutations in these non-coding sequences - called enhancers - that causes genetic diseases. &#x201C;These enhancer elements regulate gene expression. They are like switchers that tell the genes when and where to turn off and on.&#x201D; Dickel says this discovery sheds light on the unknown parts of the genome and will help improve clinical diagnosis.</description>

    <description>Researchers have found a new way to study brain disorders. Neurologist Lauren Weiss of the University of California, San Francisco is growing brain cells out of simple skin biopsies taken from patients with autism and other developmental problems. &#x201C;We can grow those cells in a lab and then turn them into stem cells, and ultimately into the cells of the brain. That&#x2019;s a pretty amazing advance when you think about how challenging it is to study the human brain. Nobody wants to give you too much access to that.&#x201D; Obtaining living neurons is complicated and may raise ethical concerns. So this new method solves these problems by effectively growing brain cells in petri dishes. &#x201C;The technology has evolved very quickly. We are increasing the number of different types of neurons we can pretty consistently make in the lab." And that gives scientists more opportunities to study brain abnormalities. For Science Today, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin.</description>

    <description>It&#x2019;s been twenty years since two University of California, San Francisco physicians proposed a new kind of a doctor &#x2013; the hospitalist. This is basically a generalist who specializes in inpatient care. Dr. Steve Pantilat was hired as a UCSF hospitalist in 1996, and three years later founded one of the nation&#x2019;s first hospital-based palliative care programs at UCSF. We asked what motivated him. "I had this longstanding interest in ethics and what I liked about palliative care is that it took the ethics and really brought it to the care of patients in a very real way." Pantilat explains that physicians caring for the very sick were often not trained to talk to their patients and their families about what decisions they wanted to make. "In palliative care, what we say is &#x201C;let&#x2019;s help you do that&#x201D;; we have expertise in this. I didn&#x2019;t even know that it was called palliative care, but then I realized it actually has a name, what I liked to do and ever since then, that&#x2019;s been the focus of my career." </description>

    <description>Why do pregnant women tend to suffer from sleep disorders? Financial status of the future mothers could be one of the reasons leading to insomnia. That&#x2019;s according to Jennifer Felder, a clinical psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco. &#x201C;Women of color and women from more economically disadvantaged background are disproportionately affected by poor sleep during pregnancy so it is possible that this may explain part of the reason we have such big disparities in the preterm birth rate.&#x201D; Lack of resources brings along other inequality factors affecting pregnant women&#x2019;s sleep. "Stress and psychological problems, noisy neighborhoods, discrimination and racism, not feeling safe.&#x201D; Felder says researchers studying different disciplines &#x2013; be it psychology, environmental science or public health - need to combine their efforts in helping low income pregnant women improve sleeping patterns.</description>

    <description>If you&#x2019;re still clutching your smartphone as you hit the sheets at night you might deprive yourself of a good night&#x2019;s sleep. That's according to a study by cardiologist Gregory Marcus of the University of California, San Francisco. So, why is a cardiologist looking into this? Marcus explains that a lack of sleep can cause high blood pressure, heart attacks, arrhythmia and strokes. "Poor sleep quality is not simply an issue of feeling tired the next day, we recognize now that sleep is extremely important to mood, to brain function, cognition." Almost 70 percent of Americans keep their phones on a bedside table at night and often scroll through content before falling asleep. Despite the health risks, Marcus says cell phones can still be our friends. "It is important not to broadly demonize technology that in general I think has such a great capacity to help enhance health." The key, Marcus says, is vigilance and putting the phone away at least an hour before sleep.</description>

    <description>When you fill out forms at the doctor&#x2019;s office, you often have to check off boxes to identify as Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian or African&#x2013;American. Noah Zaitlen of the University of California, San Francisco, says that&#x2019;s because people of different ethnic backgrounds respond differently to medication and treatments. Still, Zailten says this method is far from perfect; in fact, he found adding social and environmental factors may be just as important. "What would happen in a hospital system if instead of saying you can be Latino, let people tell me more about what community they identify with. Could we do a better job of practicing medicine if we sort of broaden these categories or maybe used some genetics to help enrich the community identification?&#x201D; So Zaitlin suggests doctors collect more information about exposure to pollutants or stress. &#x201D;And if we collected extra information, how much of the difference between drug response, diagnostic ranges, disease prevalence does that explain? And how much would that help us in the clinic?"</description>

    <description>Birdsong is like a dialect &#x2013; birds in one area may sing a different tune than those elsewhere. But at the level of physiology, it gets much more complicated. Researcher Hamish Mehaffey and his team at the University of California, San Francisco took a look at how two parts of a zebra finch brain not only enable song learning but interact to allow a bird to change its song. "So you can put electrodes in the pathways and then record in the area where they interact and look at the strengths of those inputs, after different patterns of stimulation. So what we did was we took the patterns of stimulation that we knew that the birds used when they were singing, and used those as, kind of, templates in order to probe what the mechanism might be." Mehaffey compares such a disturbance to a stroke, which can disturb a person&#x2019;s language area. "The interesting part was that there was always some balance between these two pathways. If something happens to it, the bird will sing a horrible, messed-up song." These regions are analogous to parts of the human brain and are implicated for aspects of learning and adaptation. </description>

    <description>Exposure to flame retardant chemicals or PBDEs during pregnancy can affect children&#x2019;s neurodevelopment. Environmental health scientist Tracey Woodruff of the University of California, San Francisco, found ten-fold increases in a mother's PBDE levels could lead to a drop of 3.7 IQ points in her child. While that may sound like a small number&#x2026; "If you look at it over a population, it becomes very significant, because you have everybody exposed to PBDEs at a smaller risk. The small risk over a large population means that you can have a relatively large number of people who can have some type of effect." If this happens, the population level IQ could get shifted. This means there will be more people with an IQ score of about 70, which is considered a mentally-impaired category. &#x201C;It can also decrease the number of people who are in the mentally-gifted categories." PBDEs can be found in many household items from furniture to toys to electronics. So, Woodruff says buying flame retardant-free products could make a big difference in your children&#x2019;s health.</description>

    <description>Excessively overweight women may be at higher risk of developing breast cancer. That&#x2019;s a big problem in the United States where over half the country's population is overweight or obese. &#x201C;Even though it is not a very strong risk factor it becomes so prevalent. If you look at postmenopausal women who are diagnosed with breast cancer, about a third of them are overweight or obese." Study leader Karla Kerlikowske says the hormone estrogen is to blame. "When you are a postmenopausal woman, your estrogen level becomes very low, approaching 0. But when you are obese, that fat can create estrogen metabolite, so instead of your estrogen levels being 0, they would remain higher than they would otherwise. And that circulating estrogen from being overweight women contributes to women developing breast cancer. &#x201D; So keeping body mass index under control might help you lower the risk of cancer.</description>

    <description>Hi there, hope you&#x2019;re all having a nice summer &#x2013; in case you&#x2019;ve missed some of our stories, he&#x2019;s a bit of a recap. First, atmospheric scientist Veerabadhran Ramanathan of UC San Diego&#x2019;s Scripps Institution of Oceanography is looking for a million climate warriors. To get the message out about climate change, Ramanathan is teaming up with 50 University of California academics in various disciplines to propose a hybrid course taught by about 20 faculty that combines videotaped lectures in a class that&#x2019;s devoted to discussing solutions. "These are people who can roll up their sleeves and try to solve the problem. So, I&#x2019;m on my own pathway to create those million climate warriors in the UC system." The goal is to pilot these classes first on nine UC campuses and then expand the coursework to other colleges. And on the subject of classes &#x2013; are you a parent struggling wondering whether or not to send your child to preschool? For four years, Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at UC Berkeley tracked the academic performance of over 6,000 kids up to five years of age. "We have known over the last half century that quality preschools can boost the early learning of children from poor families, but much less is known about the long-term effects of preschool on children from middle class families." But those benefits tended to come from exposure to more academically-intense preschool programs, especially those focused on developing early math skills and verbal communication. While at Berkeley, we learned how neuroscientist Adrian Chopin is trying to help people with a condition called amblyopia, in which vision in one of the eyes is reduced and leads to a loss of stereoscopic vision. "When we train people to have better stereoscopic vision, we put them in front of a computer. We project on a screen, lines of different depth. The task is just to say do you see the line in front or behind the other line, for example." Chopin explained that about 10 percent of people around the world are stereo-impaired, but the rest of us see the world in 3 dimensions and could also benefit from improved stereoscopic vision. Well, that&#x2019;s all for this week. If you miss Science Today on your local CBS radio affiliate, you can listen to all of our episodes on iTunes. Thanks for listening, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin.

    <description>A couple of decades ago flame retardants &#x2013; or PBDEs - were widely used in furniture because of the fire safety standards. But that policy has since changed in many states, including California. &#x201C;Because of concern about increasing exposures as well as the facts that people were concerned about in terms of how they may be affecting neurodevelopment, PBDE were phased out for use.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s Tracey Woodruff, an environmental health scientist at the University of California, San Francisco. She has run a study measuring pregnant women&#x2019;s exposure to PBDEs that can affect children&#x2019;s neurodevelopment and lower IQ. Woodruff found that despite a series of bans, these chemicals are still ubiquitous in our homes. &#x201C;So we see decline in some of the exposures, but we see that we still going to have exposures for a while because they are still hanging around, they probably still in a lot of furniture." Woodruff urges policymakers not to weaken environmental health laws.</description>

    <description>There&#x2019;s some good news about aging. Next week, we&#x2019;ll be featuring a story about a UC San Diego study, which found that despite physical ailments, older adults seem to consistently get happier over time. We interviewed Dr. Dilip Jeste about their work, which contradicts the conventional notions that aging is pretty much all &#x2018;gloom and doom&#x2019;. In this excerpt from our interview with Jeste, he describes what makes their study different. &#x201C;Usually, when people mention aging, they are thinking about physical aging, that's the only component that figures in ministries of aging, but aging is multidimensional. Physical health is one dimension. Another dimension is cognitive function, or cognitive health. So, that is what is being studied when we are looking at people with Alzheimer's Disease or other dementias. But the component of aging that is least studied is the psychosocial component of aging. In other words, what happens to the wellbeing, happiness, satisfaction, emotions, social activities, overall functioning? These things are not included in physical, and often in cognitive aspects of aging. So one of our goals was to look at all three components: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial, in the same study. So we got a much more comprehensive understanding of aging that many of the studies do.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Hi there, thanks for tuning in to Science Today&#x2019;s weekly roundup. As usual, we covered a range of topics and met with some really great researchers. First, as cool as it is to have a medical device to check up on the health of astronauts in deep space, it&#x2019;s even better if the same technology can be used here on Earth. That&#x2019;s just what research scientist Matthew Coleman at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory had in mind when he developed a prototype of a handheld diagnostic device for NASA. In fact, he can see it being used for environmental monitoring, too. "To look at even just water. I mean, if it works with saliva, it will certainly work with water from the environment. It could work with material isolated from insects and plants and trees. So, we could do all kinds of environmental sensing." And since the handheld device is rugged enough for space, Coleman says it would be perfect to use in the African desert, too. Meanwhile, over at the Berkeley Lab, researchers are striving to unveil the secrets about &#x2018;dark&#x2019; DNA, part of the genome that does not code proteins, but plays an important role in regulating genes. Scientist Diane Dickel has been working on finding all of these non-coding regulators, called enhancers, and is pinning them on a map. "I mean, it&#x2019;s kind of like building a road map and adding information onto that to point that particular pairs in the genome act as these enhancer elements to regulate gene expression." So, why are they doing this? The map will help researchers get a better picture of dark DNA and this, in turn, could shed light on whether mutations in the enhancers cause genetic diseases. This could be the next step towards improving genetic testing. And speaking of improvements &#x2013; a dentist at UCSF is working to get more prevention in dental care and less use of the drill. Dr. Peter Rechmann found better education about caries risk could especially help low-income patients. "The income on its own actually doesn&#x2019;t matter at all. It&#x2019;s just if someone suffers to survive, he doesn&#x2019;t have the time to spend &#x2018;x&#x2019; minutes of taking care of their teeth."

    <description>Ah, teenagers! A time often described as an emotional, hormone-laden roller-coaster ride. We chatted with UCLA's Dr. Adriana Galv&#xE1;n, whose research focuses on adolescent brain development. Specifically, her work examines how changes in brain maturation during adolescence relate to adolescent behavior and decision-making. In this excerpt, she describes one reason why adolescence is often fraught with emotion: "There is probably an evolutionary reason for why teenagers are more emotional. One reason is that emotions help us connect with other people. And during adolescence, it's really important that we establish good relationships, or understand the social rules of interacting with others, of having romantic partners, and so the emotional reactivity helps adolescents in that regard. Emotions also serve as an important learning tool. So when you feel a particular emotion, you're more likely to remember the event. So if an event was aversive, then those emotions will help you steer clear of those in the future. If an event is positive, similarly, you will also remember that in a way that is emotionally-based and more likely to re-engage in that behavior again. That emotional sensitivity can be really good for adolescents, but you can imagine how sometimes that can get them into trouble if they engage in a behavior they find very rewarding and emotional, but yet that behavior may not be good for them in the long run."</description>

    <description>A portable biodetection device that&#x2019;s bound for space so astronauts can easily give themselves health check-ups, has several terrestrial applications, too. Radiobiologist Matthew Coleman of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory explains. "We&#x2019;re really looking at science and technology impact with our handheld diagnostic device and providing really a generic platform for space travel, field medicine, in the clinic and in the environment. And I think this is also going to help to really push this idea of telemedicine and actually being able to do things like epidemiology. We could really get a lot of information about how we&#x2019;re really treating people and who&#x2019;s benefiting the most from which treatment." And this includes cancer patients. "To understand how people are responding to chemotherapy treatments throughout their whole process of being treated, so that we could quickly catch those relapsed or refractory cancers." </description>

    <description>More than half of people who suffer traumatic injury to their knee by tearing ligaments in their joint will eventually develop osteoarthritis within ten to fifteen years post-injury. This has huge quality of life issues, as well as the economic burden of medical costs. So researchers are trying to see if they can prevent cartilage degeneration immediately post-injury as a potential therapy. Biomedical scientist Gabriela Loots of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory says there are strains of mice that are not as susceptible to cartilage degeneration. "So, we&#x2019;re trying to understand what is it about the resistant strains that prevents them from having this cartilage degradation because if we can understand why they don&#x2019;t degrade, maybe we can understand what molecules we can target to prevent degradation." Loots is working on this study in collaboration with scientists at the University of California, Davis. "We try to understand what happens at the joint level, what are all the factors that contribute to post traumatic osteoarthritis." </description>

    <description>Technology, biology and medicine now go hand and hand. But state-of-the-art devices are not always available to the most vulnerable hospital patients, often because of insufficient funding. Pediatric surgeon Hanmin Lee of the University of California, San Francisco helps kick-start innovative projects to bring to clinics. &#x201C;We organize the engineering children&#x2019;s heath symposiums to try to bring all the emerging technologies to the benefit of children&#x2019;s health. &#x201D; UCSF is now developing different types of monitoring sensors, artificial organs and even orthopedic magnets that can correct skeletal deformities &#x2013; all in the hopes of advancing children&#x2019;s health. &#x201C;Little robots, all sorts of enabling technologies that we will be able to implement into children with a variety of disabilities for their benefit. And that&#x2019;s including using, for instance, augmented reality and virtual reality.&#x201D; The Miracle Babies / Advances in fetal surgery at UCSF's Fetal Treatment Center save twins in a dire situation Katherine Seligman Published 4:00 am, Sunday, December 11, 2005 LIFE SCIENCE_060_fl.jpg Doctors Robert Ball and Hanmin Lee were Anna Endter high risk obstetrician that work in the Fetal Treatment Center at UCSF.

    <description>This week on Science Today. The oldest documented person lived to 122. Was it luck, or was it genetics? Researchers at UC Berkeley recently found two genes in mice and worms that may explain why some humans can live past one hundred. "These genes are the number one correlation of extreme longevity." And while UC Berkeley scientists study aging at the molecular level, researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and UC Davis are looking to prevent the wear and tear our bodies experience over a lifetime. For instance, when a person suffers a traumatic joint injury, it often leads to damaged cartilage and this results in the development of osteoarthritis. "We try to understand what happens at the joint level, what are all the factors that contribute to post traumatic osteoarthritis." We&#x2019;ll also check in with a UC San Francisco study exploring resilience in the classroom, and how mentoring programs may be tailored to encourage these qualities in young students. "Motivation, grit, mindset &#x2013; these are all concepts that are very popular in education right now, on how to raise a successful child."

    <description>Astrophysicist Richard Klein of the University of California, Berkeley has spent years developing code for a massive simulation that covers 700,000 years of star formation. The simulation was so large that it had to be run on NASA&#x2019;s most powerful supercomputer. And now, Klein plans to create an even bigger program. "To develop a comprehensive theory of star formation, which is our ultimate goal, you have to start at large scales. And so over the last several years, we&#x2019;ve been extending the calculations to start at much larger gas clouds within the galaxy, and then evolving those simulations to the gravitational collapse of these huge clouds, all the way down to the point where they actually can form stars." The major theme of the last few years has been to bring in more relevant physics in larger scale simulations. The hope is that their expansion will more accurately reflect the initial conditions of star formation. </description>

    <description>The human brain has been studied for several centuries, but there is still a lot we don&#x2019;t understand about it. And according to radiologist Pratik Mukherjee of the University of California, San Francisco, this includes how concussions affect the brain. &#x201C;There is a controversy with soldiers that were repeatedly exposed to blasts in the battlefield, about whether they may get dementia in earlier ages and it&#x2019;s been actively investigated.&#x201D; Mukherjee says new technology, like higher quality images from MRI scanners, might be an answer that doctors, researchers and injured patients have long been looking for. "The brain is harder than other organs, even other important organs like the heart and so while it&#x2019;s been recognized that this is a big problem for centuries and even if you look at prior wars, where they talk about shell shock in WWI where they had a lot of artillery explosion for the first time. They are basically describing these repetitive blast injuries, their concussions, but they just didn&#x2019;t have the tools to understand any of that at that time."</description>

    <description>When we think about what sustains our bodies, copper isn&#x2019;t usually the first thing that comes to mind. But according to chemist Chris Chang of the University of California, Berkeley, it&#x2019;s vital to many biological functions, from nutrition to signaling in the nervous system. After learning that copper is given to cows to control weight gain, Chang looked into its role in fat metabolism and obesity. His team started with plates of cultured fat cells, then moved on to a mouse model. "What we ended up finding was that copper was a necessary component for the mice to be able to burn fat. And so what happens is if the mice don&#x2019;t have enough copper in their fat cells, then they can&#x2019;t undergo this process of fat burning, the act of breaking larger pieces of fat into smaller pieces of fat for energy. Then it predisposes you to having larger buildup of fat and of hence of obesity." Since a copper imbalance can lead to metabolic issues and other diseases, Chang plans to further study how the element might be used as a therapy or possible treatment.

    <description>If you live with a teenager, you&#x2019;ve probably blamed some of their antics solely on puberty and hormones. But according to new research at UCLA, it&#x2019;s also that their brains are still undergoing some remodeling. Psychologist Adriana Galv&#xE1;n, who directs UCLA&#x2019;s Developmental Neuroscience Lab, says the common assumption has been that as kids enter the teen years, they need less sleep. "But in fact, they need just as much sleep, maybe even more so. And there&#x2019;s actually a tendency for teenagers to sleep less, not simply because they&#x2019;re on social media or they&#x2019;re staying up late to complete homework, but because there&#x2019;s a biological shift in how the brain induces sleep." Basically, the sleep hormone melatonin, is not released in teens until later in the night. In a study of how sleep affects their developing brains, Galv&#xE1;n found that a lack of sleep affects a teen&#x2019;s pre-frontal cortex the most. "And that translates into poorer performance on a self-control task &#x2013; and that impacts their ability to regulate emotions or pay attention in class."</description>

    <description>This is Science Today. What can leap into the air, spring off a wall and perform multiple jumps in a row? That would be Salto &#x2013; the most vertically agile, wall-jumping robot ever built. Roboticist Duncan Haldane, a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, led the work. "The special thing about this robot is that it can jump higher and faster than any other robot that&#x2019;s out there right now. Salto can jump better than a human; once it does that jump, Salto jumps again. So, we can do this really high-powered jumping behavior continuously and chain together these maneuvers made out of large leaps." Salto&#x2019;s design was based on a galago &#x2013; the most vertically agile animal in nature. These creatures have a special ability to store energy in their tendons so they can jump to heights not possible by muscles alone. This is done while in a crouched position. "So what we built into Salto the capability for a super crouch. What that allows is to have the motor be able to stretch out the spring and keep the robot crouched for longer." Such novel locomotive abilities could be used in search and rescue efforts. For Science Today, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin.</description>

    <description>Environmental pollutants can damage our health, but how much do we know about their harmful effects? As part of a prenatal patients&#x2019; study, Tracey Woodruff, an environmental health scientist at the University of California, San Francisco has surveyed OBGYNs. The goal was to find out if doctors inform their patients about environmental health as part of their prenatal care. &#x201C;We actually surveyed doctors, obstetricians to ask them do you talk to your patients about environmental health, what do they say to you, do you think it is an important issue to ask them. And doctors by and large, at least obstetricians said we think this issue is really Important, but we don&#x2019;t talk to our patients because we don&#x2019;t have the kind of information we need to give to them.&#x201D; Woodruff and her team are now filling in the gap integrating environmental health into clinical care. &#x201C;One thing we have been doing is working with their professional societies to provide this foundational information so it is easier for a physician to give a patient information about environmental exposure they are concerned about.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>One the objectives of a new physician training curriculum at the University of California, San Francisco is to ensure that future doctors can speak to their patients in an understandable way. Dr. Anna Chang of the University of California, San Francisco, who helped develop the Bridges curriculum, explains that doctors do need to translate everything the patients say into medical language. "The patients will say, &#x201C;I have a pain in my elbow and I&#x2019;ve had a pain in my elbow for some weeks. We have to translate that to each other in order to diagnose that and treat that into something like, &#x201C;This is a patient who has had an intermittent oligoarthritis for a subacute duration.&#x201D; And that sounds nothing like what the patient told us." Doctors often continue using this language with patients. "So starting with day one, we are asking our students to practice what the world looks like from their patients&#x2019; perspectives."</description>

    <description>A medical device that could be used in deep space to check up on the health of astronauts, could also someday be used for various environmental monitoring here on terra firma. "I mean, if it works with saliva, it will certainly work with water from the environment; it could work with material isolated from insects and plants and trees. So we could do all kinds of environmental sensing." That&#x2019;s Matthew Coleman, a senior research scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He says that if they can make a handheld diagnostic device like this rugged enough for space, it would also be perfect in the African desert. "We&#x2019;re thinking of something that&#x2019;s doesn&#x2019;t require a cold storage, so you don&#x2019;t have to keep it in the refrigerator until you use it. You&#x2019;ll just have to add water or an actual blood or saliva or breath condensate sample."</description>

    <description>Chemotherapy drugs can have brutal side effects, impacting everything from digestion to the nervous system. But what if these drugs could be localized at the site of a tumor to reduce these harms? This is what researcher Chelsea Chen of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab is working towards: new drug-capture materials that are essentially chemical sponges. The polymer devices are called ChemoFilters. "We insert this ChemoFilter through a tiny tube into the body, and the device would be placed right next to the tumor. It is used to capture the chemotherapy drug, and that&#x2019;s past the tumor, before it enters the body&#x2019;s circulation. That way it decreases the systemic toxicities." While the device was conceived with liver cancer in mind, Chen is working on ChemoFilters that can absorb other chemotherapy drugs as well. "The ChemoFilter will have broad use, but on the other hand, it&#x2019;s not applicable to all types of cancers." To be used on humans, the device will require additional testing for federal approval. </description>

    <description>Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have created a novel simulation visualizing over 700,000 years of star formation. The project took several months on NASA&#x2019;s supercomputer, for a total of 1 million hours across thousands of processors. Since this sort of simulation is so computationally intensive, astrophysicist Richard Klein used a mathematical technique called &#x201C;adaptive mesh refinement&#x201D; to focus in on certain aspects of the evolving stars. "This enables you to select what regions of a large-scale computational domain you want to focus on in a simulation, and enable you in a dynamic way to have high resolution in those areas that are critically important for understanding the astrophysical phenomenon, while letting other regions of the computation be at much lower resolution and therefore lower cost." Before this technique, Klein says this type of simulation would have been computationally impossible. </description>

    <description>This week on Science Today, we learned a lot from University of California researchers. For instance, radiologist Pratik Mukherjee at UCSF told us even though people often don&#x2019;t pay much attention to small brain injuries &#x2013; like those suffered in a fall or a minor car collision &#x2013; these types of traumas should never be ignored. "There is a significant minority ranging from anywhere between one-fifth to one-third of people who have what&#x2019;s called persistent post-concussive syndrome where for months or even years after the injury they have continued problems like headaches, dizziness, insomnia, depression, problems with thinking." These small brain injuries may go undetected by traditional MRI scans, so Mukherjee is using more advanced image capturing technology for diagnosing these concussions and this may allow researchers to predict if injured people will continue experiencing symptoms later in life. On the subject of new technology, researchers at UC Berkeley may have a game changer when it comes to vaccinations. Mechanical and bioengineer Dorian Liepmann developed a proof-of-concept for a needleless technology that&#x2019;s designed to self-administer vaccines orally. "What we have is a pill that actually shoots a jet of drug into your cheek without pain. We use a reaction in here just like vinegar and baking soda &#x2013; once it starts reacting, it makes a gas and builds up pressure inside of the pill and it shoots a jet of the drug into the cheek." The team is also looking to design a smaller pill form that could be used for diabetics who could swallow a pill instead of administering an insulin injection. These are just some of the discoveries we covered this week. Listen to Science Today episodes on Soundcloud or subscribe to the program on iTunes to catch some more.

    <description>Younger women are more likely to develop breast cancer if their breasts are dense. This means they have more supportive tissue, rather than fatty tissue, around the ducts. That&#x2019;s according to a new study by Karla Kerlikowske of the University of California, San Francisco. &#x201C;The risk of breast cancer increases with age, but if you look among younger women who do develop breast cancer, more of them will have dense breasts. &#x201C; Cancer rarely develops in fat, so that&#x2019;s why when it comes to breast density older women have a smaller risk of developing the disease. And that&#x2019;s because compared to younger women, they tend to have fatty breast tissue. &#x201C;In older women it maybe a third of women that have dense breasts, when in premenopausal women it is about two-thirds of women who have dense breasts. It is a more common risk factor, but it is also a strong risk factor. &#x201D;</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. It&#x2019;s been 20 years since two UC San Francisco physicians proposed a new kind of doctor &#x2013; a hospitalist &#x2013; which is basically a generalist who specializes in inpatient care. Dr. Steve Pantilat was hired at UCSF as a hospitalist in 1996. And while I may be dating myself, I first interviewed Pantilat not long after. Then, about three years after his hire, he founded one of the nation&#x2019;s first hospital-based palliative care programs at UCSF. Recently, I asked what motivated him at the time. "I had this longstanding interest in ethics and what I liked about palliative care is that it took the ethics and really brought it to the care of patients in a very real way." Palliative care has been the focus of Pantilat&#x2019;s career ever since. Meanwhile, at the Berkeley Lab, physical chemist Kevin Wilson has been focused on the clouds &#x2013; his lab simulated the microphysics of how cloud droplets form. "We hope that we can develop more accurate predictions that ultimately can go into models, climate models, that hopefully long term, will give us more accurate predictions of the kinds of climate change processing we might expect in the future." And have you heard of the American Gut Project? This is a crowdcsourced, crowdfunded citizen science project co-founded by Rob Knight of UC San Diego. The project allows anyone to see what their microbiome looks like. "At the moment, I should point out that the benefit is primarily in terms of scientific knowledge and just understanding what makes a difference to your microbiome and what doesn&#x2019;t. But as an increasing number of diseases get linked to the microbiome, it&#x2019;s possible that in the future, we&#x2019;ll be able to develop tests for particular diseases that are based on the microbiome."

    <description>Male fetuses may be more sensitive than females to maternal smoking, before and during a woman&#x2019;s pregnancy. Chemicals in tobacco may lead to increased vulnerability of developing lymphocytes and cause genetic damage or what scientists call deletions. That&#x2019;s according to a study by Adam de Smith, an associate researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. "Male fetuses grow quicker than females. So we think perhaps there could be a higher rate of turnover of immune cells in male fetuses compared with females. Those male immune cells are more prone to developing these deletions." Inflammation in mothers&#x2019; bodies during pregnancy, possibly exacerbated by tobacco smoke exposure, might also trigger genetic mutations. "It has been shown that there are differences between the inflammation that&#x2019;s found in mothers carrying male fetuses compared with females. I believe it is a higher inflammation with a male fetus. So that&#x2019;s another potential mechanism for increasing the number of deletions."</description>

    <description>Hi there! It&#x2019;s been a busy week here at Science Today. We learned that diagnosing brain disorders can often be a challenge for doctors because some psychological diseases have overlapping symptoms. These include memory loss in patients with depression and suppressed mood in people suffering from dementia. But radiologist Cyrus Raji of UC San Francisco led a study, which found that neuroimaging and machine learning can help improve diagnosis. "Each individual had a perfusion neuroimaging, where this is a nuclear tracer injected into them and that allowed the mapping of the blood flow in the brain and that allows us to quantify blood flow in 128 regions and use machine learning analysis to separate who had depression or cognitive disorders or both." Raji explains that machine learning is often used to quickly process and analyze patient&#x2019;s data in digital format &#x2013; and it may be used in the future to find new biomarkers that can help in deciphering if one has a brain disorder vs. another issue. While on campus, we also visited pediatric surgeon Hanmin Lee, who is working to get more pediatric grants to provide devices and therapeutics for children. Right now, Lee says when it comes to spending on research and innovation, adults get the lion&#x2019;s share of benefits. "The market for most drugs and devices is significantly better and bigger and more robust in the adult world. I think we just need to be staunch advocates for children. I firmly believe that that is the best investment that you could make, is in the health of our children." And finally, some great news for advocates for coral reef preservation. A decade-long study led by Jennifer Smith of UC San Diego&#x2019;s Scripps Institution of Oceanography has found that remote coral reefs can thrive despite threats posed by climate change. Smith says coral reefs surrounding remote islands were dramatically healthier than those in populated areas subject to a variety of human impacts, including overfishing and coastal development. "In a healthy coral reef, you have a landscape that is dominated by these beautiful reef building corals that are really the ecosystem engineers - that provides food and shelter for all the other organisms that live in that ecosystem." This shows that preservation efforts can buy researchers time as they figure out how to deal with the threat posed by ocean warming. That&#x2019;s it for the weekly update &#x2013; to hear more episodes about University of California research, subscribe to Science Today on iTunes or follow us on Soundcloud. I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin &#x2013; have a great Mother&#x2019;s Day weekend.</description>

    <description>One of the big issues in the field of renewable energy is coming up with better energy storage methods. The goal is to have systems with what&#x2019;s called &#x2018;high energy density&#x2019;, so it holds a lot of energy, but can be discharged and charged quickly. To this end, staff scientist Marcus Worsley of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory says their team has joined forces with researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz to create the first 3D-printed supercapacitor using an ultra-lightweight graphene aerogel. "That&#x2019;s one of the big efforts here is to make some of these holy grail sort of devices. And the expertise that we have here in materials synthesis, as well as 3D printing, and additive manufacturing, we&#x2019;d like to kind of join those things together, which is why we have this collaboration going on between engineering and physical and life science to really try to take on some of these very big challenges that face us today." The graphene-based inks used in their 3D printed supercapacitors opens the door to a whole host of novel designs of highly efficient energy storage systems. </description>

    <description>In the emerging field of 3D bioprinting, there are those who work with synthetic materials, and others who use materials that come from nature. Bioengineer Monica Moya of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has used a 3D printer and a &#x2018;bio-ink&#x2019; made of materials compatible with the human body to create living blood vessels. "So one of our inks is made out of the same stuff that you find in a blood clot. And we intentionally do this because we are in a sense, are co-engineering with the cells. So, we&#x2019;re using materials that the cells recognize and understand what they&#x2019;re supposed to do. So that kind of takes the pressure off of us because then the cells are going to do the things that they already know how to do without us having to tell them, because you know, they are the original engineers of life. They already know how to build blood vessels &#x2013; and so what we do is we kind of orchestrate that whole process." Their bioprinted vasculature system could be used for toxicology studies, medical treatment testing and provide a test bed for the ultimate goal in the field - printing implantable organs. </description>

    <description>Medical students at the University of California, San Francisco, are learning about the human body in a new, experimental setting. Anatomy professor Derek Harmon is piloting a virtual reality class. But as exciting as it sounds - not every student is thrilled about the 3D experience. "I think one potential negative with virtual reality is that some studies quote that something like 20 percent of people or 1 out of 5 have this motion sickness." So, Harmon says for that reason some of his anatomy students opted out. But the class is optional, designed in addition to the traditional mandatory classes taught on cadavers. "Virtual reality is one way we are looking at it. We are looking at augmented reality concepts too. Potentially mixed reality like a HoloLens, to try to make sure that we can get as many students involved in this type of space as possible." According to Harmon, the concept of spatial building that three-dimension provides is a very important skill for medical students. And it&#x2019;s easier to understand using virtual reality.</description>

    <description>Over a year after the city of Berkeley, California implemented a &#x2018;soda tax&#x2019;, a team of researchers have reported a 21 percent drop in the consumption of soda and other sugary beverages in Berkeley&#x2019;s low-income neighborhoods. Study author Kris Madsen of the University of California, Berkley&#x2019;s School of Public Health, says this is an encouraging sign in the fight against obesity. "The initial results in Berkeley certainly suggest that soda taxes do exactly what we&#x2019;re hoping they&#x2019;ll do &#x2013; and that&#x2019;s reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. And it&#x2019;s the kind of evidence that we really want because what we&#x2019;re trying to find are tools that can change people&#x2019;s behaviors. Education alone has not been effective. But if this is a really effective tool, then it&#x2019;s a tool we need to use." Madsen adds that it was also encouraging to note the substantial decline was reported in low-income communities because they often bear the brunt of the health consequences of obesity and diabetes.

    <description>Will doctors of the future and their patients learn to speak the same language? The University of California, San Francisco recently set this ambitious goal with a radically updated curriculum called Bridges. The idea is to get new students involved with clinical teams from the very start - something that traditionally trained doctors did not get to do until a decade into their practice. Dr. Anna Chang, who helped develop Bridges, says a big part of the training is about mindset: to put physicians in the patient's shoes. "We allow first year medical students to work on things like decreasing unnecessary hospital readmissions, to improve patients' understanding of high risk medications or to decrease waiting times in emergency departments - devise strategists to help patients make their appointments." So instead of just memorizing facts in their classrooms the way the old-school doctors did, Chang says, the Bridges' students get out there in the field and learn real-world skills.</description>

    <description>After a five-year voyage, NASA&#x2019;s Juno spacecraft has arrived at Jupiter this month, prepared to orbit the planet 32 times over the next year. But before Juno&#x2019;s approach, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley worked hard to map the gas giant from the Earth. Astronomer Imke de Pater and her team used radio emissions from Jupiter&#x2019;s ammonia-filled atmosphere to create these maps, and says they will complement the data collected by Juno. "We essentially can provide context images for the Juno data." de Pater&#x2019;s detailed maps can help explain features like the ammonia abundance at different locations on the planet. The Juno spacecraft will fly inside what&#x2019;s known as radiation belts to collect data. "Everything on Jupiter changes. And so we will get a lot of data at different wavelengths. And since they&#x2019;re all now taken at the same time we can interpret all the data together and really get a good understanding of Jupiter&#x2019;s atmosphere." Researchers will probe at different levels of the atmosphere, from below the cloud layers to the stratosphere. </description>

    <description>Every hour, one person can shed about 37 million microbes into the air. That&#x2019;s something to consider while spending 8 hours in windowless office buildings, not to mention any time spent on an airplane! Jonathan Allen, a bioinformatics scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is part of a new, national panel that will study how microbial communities of organisms (or microbiomes) can affect human health in 'built environments'. "How can we apply the current technologies that are being used to study the microbiome in a broad array of research areas and apply them, to really advance the field in building design and interactions with people? What are the open challenges, where do the research efforts need to go to actually develop the practical information that&#x2019;s going to really impact building design?" The panel plans to assess the current base of knowledge in this field and identify research gaps to improve future building design. They will also look into other built environments like cars, subways and hospitals, where the aim will be to limit the spread of infectious disease</description>

    <description>What can the genetic material of sperm teach us about its function? Researcher Polina Lishko of the University of California, Berkeley is trying to better understand the cell&#x2019;s physiology by documenting the RNA transcripts. These are essentially the instructions from which a protein is built based on a person&#x2019;s DNA. "So transcripts is like a template from which protein will be synthesized. They&#x2019;re important for the sperm function, for the sperm structure, for the sperm identity." Basically, Lishko and her team put together a reference manual for sperm research, which can help researchers predict what proteins a sperm cell might produce and why. "We created a database of what proteins are present in the human sperm cell. This will provide a roadmap for other researchers to understand exactly what is there, and how human sperm cells are different from other cells." </description>

    <description>3D bioprinting is an emerging technology in which 3D printers are used with bio-inks to artificially construct living tissue by outputting layers of living cells. To do this, research engineer Monica Moya of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory says bioprinters need to output a dissolvable gel to support and protect cells during printing. "So we have to keep them happy before they&#x2019;re going to be printed, during the print process and then afterwards. And so during the print process, the biggest challenge that we have is when they&#x2019;re going through those nozzles. We have to make sure that the gel is the right kind of consistency. So, it&#x2019;s sort of a Goldilocks conundrum, where it has to be just right." Too liquid and researchers have a puddle instead of a structure; too stiff and they can shear cells, causing them to burst and die. So, what is the right consistency? "Well, it&#x2019;s kind of like snot, where it&#x2019;s a little bit formed but it&#x2019;s still kind of liquid, enough so that the cells can come out in a liquid form." Moya&#x2019;s team has bioprinted an unorganized network of blood vessels &#x2013; a feat that could someday revolutionize medical practice.</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today, we learned that a major risk factor for breast cancer is a woman&#x2019;s breast structure &#x2013; specifically, what&#x2019;s called breast density. Karla Kerlikowske of the University of California, San Francisco explains it&#x2019;s a radiologic term because on a mammogram, doctors look at how much dense tissue someone has versus how much fat tissue. "We found breast density was four times more likely to account for the development of breast cancer than having a first degree relative who'd had breast cancer." So Kerlikowske recommends that women in this risk group should pay extra attention to screening. Meanwhile, at UCLA, we talked to Karen Gylys at the School of Nursing, who says when it comes to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, some simple lifestyle changes can make a huge difference &#x2013; even in patients who are already cognitively impaired. "So things like exercise, things like Mediterranean diet, fish oil, there&#x2019;s evidence that that these things can move the dial on neuropsychiatric tests in elderly subjects and in some studies in elderly subjects who are beginning to be impaired." And the added benefit? These lifestyle changes are also good for your heart. Now while we&#x2019;re on the subject of the brain &#x2013; have you ever heard of a mini brain? Jokes aside, it&#x2019;s an emerging 3D technology created from adult stem cells. "Mini brains can allow you to ask some questions that are more challenging to ask about a single cell, essentially in isolation vs. what happens when cells are moving through more of a three-dimensional space and interacting with each other in three-dimensions as well." That&#x2019;s neurologist Lauren Weiss at the University of California, San Francisco. She&#x2019;s been studying brain disorders in the lab looking at neurons grown from skin cells and says a mini-brain is the next step in research because it recreates the structure of a real brain. Well, that&#x2019;s it for this weekly update. To hear full episodes about the latest research at the University of California, please subscribe to Science Today on iTunes or follow us on Soundcloud. You&#x2019;ll be more informed if you do! Thank for listening, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin - have a great weekend!</description>

    <description>Every year, more than 25 thousand pounds of chemicals are imported or manufactured in the United States, but scientists have very little data on many of those chemicals&#x2019; heath effects. Tracy Woodruff, an environmental health scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, explains. "We do know a lot about some environmental chemicals, so air pollution, cigarette smoke, some carcinogens and chemicals that cause effects other than cancer. There is still a lot of scientific knowledge to be gained about any of the industrial chemicals that we are using currently in the market place and we are exposed to.&#x201D; Woodruff says the effect of chemicals on humans is often underestimated, because most studies involve lab animals. &#x201C;But that doesn&#x2019;t really reflect somebody who lives in a neighborhood that has a lot of crime or they are low income and so they have a lot of other stressers in their lives.&#x201D; Woodruff says measuring the combined health effects of people&#x2019;s social and environmental hardships could give researchers a more complete picture.</description>

    <description>With so little room for a diagnostic lab, what happens when an astronaut gets ill in space? And what if we could even prevent a medical issue from happening? In this interview excerpt, Matthew Coleman, a senior research scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory describes a revolutionary, small handheld diagnostic device that can work with three different sample streams. Have a listen: Transcript: "So, one of the problems for space exploration is that there's limited room to take a lot of equipment in a diagnostic laboratory with you, and have it on, say the Space Station, or as you move to explore someplace like Mars. And so what we've been working on, is developing a small handheld diagnostic device that's kind of revolutionary in the fact that it can work with different types of sample streams to do both analytical diagnostics of health, and do differential blood cell counts because combined, those two things can give you a lot of information about your current health status; if you're pre-symptomatic to something, or if you're developing somewhere along your progression to a diseased state. So, in our case, we're actually working on three different sample types. Two are non-invasive. So one is saliva, and the other one is actually breath. So, small volatiles in breath, can actually diagnose something about whether you have diabetes. It's much like a breathalyzer that the police use to know if you've been drinking. We can measure those small molecules in your breath, but also breath has a liquid component. It's called breath condensate. And that breath condensate can have some of the same proteins you find in blood and in saliva, that can also be used to diagnose health. So we can find proteins that are related to cancer or cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and even infection within that condensate. So then the third sample we're looking at is blood, because blood is the clinical standard, which all the doctors use. When you go to the doctor, you know they always take a small tube of 3 ml. to 5 ml. of blood and they're going to count your blood cells and be able to relate that to, whether you have anemia, even if you possibly have cancer, and your general health status based on measuring protein biomarkers or proteins in your blood as well. Right? So you get your HDL measurement, that's done through a diagnostic kit called an ELISA to measure some specific proteins in your blood. And so we're going to provide one single device that can measure all three of those sample streams, and tell you something about proteins, your blood differentials, and what's in your breath."

    <description>What causes asthma and allergies? Scientists think it may very well stem from our own mothers. Susan Lynch, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Francisco, has been studying the origin of these diseases and says it all starts with a woman's lifestyle when she is pregnant or right after she has given birth. "Some of the risk factors for allergic asthma include very early life exposures, such as a lack of the mother's exposure to livestock or furred pets, while she is pregnant, formula feeding, cesarean section delivery and antibiotic use either during pregnancy or in the very early life postnatal period." All these factors define the types of microbes that form in our bodies and could drive our immune system's dysfunction. "In very early life, the gut microbiome changes very dramatically as it accumulates bacterial and fungal genomes and species from the environment." So changing this environment even before women start thinking of having babies - might be one of the easiest ways to prevent asthma and allergies.</description>

    <description>NASA&#x2019;s Juno space probe has arrived at Jupiter, which will give astronomer Imke de Pater of the University of California, Berkeley the opportunity to expand upon her already detailed maps of the giant planet. de Pater&#x2019;s maps documented Jupiter&#x2019;s global circulation patterns, or the movement of gases through the atmosphere. This also occurs on Earth, where the circulation of air distributes heat across the planet. "When you just look at Jupiter, you see clouds, you see brownish and whitish bands. The whitish ones are called zones and the brown ones are called the belts. The ammonia gas will condense out and form clouds. And so above that cloud deck, ammonia is basically dry air. And that dry air will then descend back down into neighboring belt regions. So that&#x2019;s sort of a circulation pattern of air rising, then condensing out, and dry air sinking down. In a way, global circulations on Jupiter may help understand global circulations on the Earth." </description>

We spoke to electrical and computer engineer Yasamin Mostofi of UC Santa Barbara who is using existing WiFi signals to essentially conduct a headcount. But why? "You need to be able to estimate your occupancy with WiFi signals. We want to figure out how many people were there, which areas are more crowded, then the heating and cooling can be optimized accordingly." If counting calories is more your thing, you may want to know more about added sugars in your diet. This is the one of the most significant contributors to diseases like diabetes and heart attacks, so Kris Madsen of UC Berkeley says if everyone was aware of this, there would be a better chance that public health agencies and municipalities could partner with industry to produce healthier products for people to consume. Madsen recently found that a soda tax in Berkeley led to lower consumption of sugary drinks in low-income neighborhoods. "I think some would say sugar-sweetened beverages have been unfairly singled out, they are not the only problematic item in our diet. This is true. There&#x2019;s a few things about them that really makes them stand out &#x2013; first of all, they are the largest source of added sugars in the American&#x2019;s diet; the other problem is that we don&#x2019;t usually compensate for those calories." This week we also visit the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where engineers are looking to overcome one of the current limitations of commercial 3D printers on the market &#x2013; that is, the lack of material that&#x2019;s being used. Engineer Chen Zhu helped develop a novel, ultra-lightweight graphene aerogel to expand the fabrication of devices or functional materials. "So first we developed the graphene aerogel ink that&#x2019;s a printable ink, so that means the material is easy to flow through the very small nozzle and after squeezing the printing, the material can maintain the shape and it&#x2019;s not going to shrink or collapse or deform." There&#x2019;s just so much research going on at the University of California &#x2013; subscribe to Science Today on iTunes or follow us on Soundcloud or Stitcher to hear these and other episodes.

    <description>Asthma and allergies begin in our guts. Susan Lynch, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Francisco, has made this discovery while studying stool samples from newborn babies. Lynch found that certain types of bacteria that healthy infants usually have, were missing in the group she tested. "Perhaps, microbial metabolism in the gut is reprogrammed in this high risk group that lacks these bacteria." Lynch explains that microbes in the guts of unhealthy children were digesting amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids - the building blocks of our bodies - in an abnormal way. And that&#x2019;s something scientists were not able to prove before. "This was the first time we could show definitely that the products associated with the microbiota in the gut drive immune dysfunction." This bacterial disruption put children at higher risk of developing allergies at age 2 and asthma at age 4.</description>

    <description>How much stress can you take? Maybe you&#x2019;re OK with a small bump in the road, like a parking ticket or a spat with your neighbor. But what about more serious troubles? &#x201C;Things like going through a divorce, financial troubles, unemployment. Those are pretty big stressors.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s Irene Mauss, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley. In her recent study, she discovered that you will be much better off if you accept your negative emotions, no matter how bad they are. &#x201C;We found the same positive effect of emotional acceptance. I don&#x2019;t know at this point where the upper boundary is, but from other research we can speculate that actually there is no upper boundary in terms of the intensity of stressors." But Mauss says accepting your negative emotions doesn&#x2019;t mean accepting negative reality. You should still work on making positive changes in your life if things took a wrong turn.</description>

    <description>The flow of time has been pondered by the likes of Aristotle, Augustine and Einstein. Now, physicist Richard Muller, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, has proposed a new theory. "My theory postulates that space and time are so tightly linked in general relativity that if create more space, you&#x2019;re creating more time. If the expansion of time, starting with the Big Bang and now coasting ahead is constantly creating more space, it must also be creating new time and the newly creating space is the space between the galaxies and the newly created time is what we call &#x2018;now&#x2019;." Muller&#x2019;s theory of the flow of time led to a collaboration with Caltech that explains the theory in more detail &#x2013; using mathematics &#x2013; and proposes a way to test it using LIGO, an experiment that detects gravitational waves created by merging black holes. Stay tuned!</description>

    <description>There&#x2019;s still a lot of the unknown when it comes to the long-term impacts of space travel, so there is a big push by NASA to better understand these effects. At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, radiobiologist Matt Coleman is part of team that has developed a small medical device that provides a comprehensive in-flight medical diagnostic system. Coleman explains that it can detect diseases from long-term exposure to microgravity and exposure to radiation. "This tool we&#x2019;re building, you know we think it&#x2019;s going to have a huge health benefit, but it&#x2019;s going to have a huge research benefit because we don&#x2019;t really know how do all of these things actually respond in space, in exploration, in research animals, let alone humans. And so getting this up into space and even on the International Space Station, it will have a huge benefit, just in the research that we can do." The portable diagnostic device can also be used for battlefield medicine, in Third World countries or even in the case of a radiological event like Chernobyl or Fukishima.</description>

    <description>The amount of time spent in pre-K education is important, especially for kids from low-income families. This, according to education professor Bruce Fuller of the University of California, Berkeley. &#x201C;If kids were growing up in poor households, a lot of these parents were working swing shifts, grave yard shifts, or they can&#x2019;t afford high quality children&#x2019;s books. So it is probably a resource problem. But when young kids are growing up in these more impoverished settings, then a quality pre-school can pack a much bigger punch." Their study also found that middle-class kids showed no change in their academic performance if they stayed in pre-school for a whole day versus half-day. &#x201C;If the teachers are very intentional about introducing cognitively challenging tasks, getting around in circle time digging into kids books, teaching kids how to count in colorful blocks, you can sort of get a big boost of that in 3 to 4 hours. After that kids might be outside on playground or the teachers getting tired. &#x201D; So, Fuller urges educators and researchers to get a better understanding of how differing features of pre-K may benefit all children.</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today: Astrophysicist Richard Klein of the University of California, Berkeley gives us a glimpse at his new supercomputer simulation that covers 700,000 years of star formation. "So we start with these turbulent magnetized clouds. Follow the cloud for up to a million years of evolution, all the way to the point where stars can form in clusters." Klein is currently working on an even larger simulation and hopes they will lead to a comprehensive theory of star formation. With this next piece, we pull our heads out of the clouds and dive into the world of cephalopods &#x2013; creatures like squid, octopus, and cuttlefish. Although these animals lead strikingly colorful lives, they&#x2019;re thought to be colorblind. But UC Berkeley graduate student Alexander Stubbs theorizes that their bizarre pupil shape can in fact help them detect color. "And what we showed in this paper is that their fairly unique pupil shape &#x2013; with a U-shaped pupil in cuttlefish and squid or a dumbbell shaped bar pupil in octopus &#x2013; means that they blur their image, but in a color dependent way." To test his theory, Stubbs had to get creative. His father, Christopher Stubbs of Harvard University, programmed a computer simulation to model this type of eyesight, showing how this color blurring may help explain the paradox of cephalopod vision. We then visit UCLA, where we speak with professor Karen Gylys about how she creatively studies the brain to better understand Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. Gylys can essentially isolate synapses - the space between two neurons. "It&#x2019;s cryopreserved so that we can get these little spherical, they&#x2019;re called &#x2018;synaptosomes.&#x2019; And so that gives us the ability to sort of see into the synapse &#x2013; to study what&#x2019;s happening. We actually purify thousands and thousands synapses." If you want learn more about research at the University of California, subscribe to UC Science Today on iTunes or Stitcher.

    <description>Space missions are exciting, but they&#x2019;re risky for astronauts&#x2019; health. The lack of gravity in space may seriously damage their musculoskeletal systems, especially the spine and hip. Thomas Lang, an imaging scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, has recently discovered crucial details about bone loss in space. &#x201C;What we did in our study is to look at how this corresponded to architectural changes in the hips. We used a 3-dimentional approach called quantitative computed tomography and in particular in the hip we found the trabecular bone &#x2013; the spongy bone in the center of the medullary canal in the hip - was lost at about up to 3 percent per month.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s similar to the bone structure that 70 or 80-year old women might lose in a year. &#x201C;The driving factor is disuse. Very similar to what happens when somebody has a spinal cord injury and they sit down in a wheel chair.&#x201D; One solution is to ensure that astronauts get strenuous workouts in space.</description>

    <description>When you are hungry, you may notice that your sense of smell grows stronger. But what happens to our appetite if we have a stuffy nose? According to Andrew Dillin, a molecular biologist of the University of California, Berkeley, we don&#x2019;t necessarily eat less, but our metabolism does get affected. &#x201C;If there is this lack of smell, this perception of the sense of smell, the body is wired to burn all the food that comes in. It doesn&#x2019;t store any of it." While working on his study, Dillin has discovered that lab animals lacking a sense of smell remained thin even after eating fatty food. &#x201C;There is something about the wiring of the sensory system of smell into the brain to control the rest of the body&#x2019;s metabolism." And while this may sound like a great way to lose weight, scientists still don&#x2019;t know exactly how the sensory organs for smell are integrated with the brain. Dillin says this requires more research in the lab &#x2013; and then there will be more work looking into if the mice research translates to humans and if they, too, can effectively lose weight if their sense of smell is altered.</description>

    <description>By probing down into Jupiter&#x2019;s cloudy atmosphere, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have created the most detailed radio map of the largest planet in our Solar System. Astronomer Imke de Pater and her team used an observatory in New Mexico to take the images. "So we were able to produce this map at radio wavelengths because the Very Large Array in New Mexico had undergone upgrades and improved by a factor of 10 in sensitivity." Since the planet rotates every 10 hours, past radio maps would end up smeared. But thanks to the upgrade, this new map shows detailed layers of ammonia gas welling up and sinking down in Jupiter&#x2019;s atmosphere. "We could see just all kinds of different features. For example, the Great Red Spot, and other little ovals and storm systems on Jupiter." de Pater says the next step is to collect more data and probe deeper into the cloud layers. Researchers hope these findings will help explain the atmospheres of other planets as well. </description>

    <description>Does talking or singing to a newborn really their brain development? This week on Science Today, we chatted with neurologist Mercedes Paredes of the University of California, San Francisco to find out. She says this type of stimulation may affect inhibitory neurons, which keep fine-tuning and shaping infants&#x2019; brains during the first couple months of life. "These cells are reaching their target, these brain regions that control the development of motor skills, social skills and language skills. So, I imagine that they might play a role in that. And understanding how they do that will be important for parents knowing, OK, these are the foundations of how the milestones develop." And as far as we&#x2019;re concerned, talking or singing to newborns is hard to resist! But how about when those babies become adolescents? There may not be as much talking going then as they hole up in their rooms using social media. But how is that affecting their brains? UCLA&#x2019;s Adriana Galv&#xE1;n says there&#x2019;s still not enough data to determine the impact because the media itself is still relatively new. "And so we don&#x2019;t have the long-term data over many years to determine what it&#x2019;s doing to the brain, but certainly we do know that it&#x2019;s another form of teenagers having more social interactions, having greater reactions emotionally to things that they see on media or read about, but we don&#x2019;t really know what it&#x2019;s doing to the brain, yet, but stay tuned - a lot of people are doing that research." Finally, with heavy rainfalls helping quench the parched state of California, there are some questions being raised in the aftermath of drought. UC Berkeley biologist Todd Dawson says in the last couple of years, droughts have killed millions of trees in the Golden State. "Will we have to manage our forests in different ways? So for example, we have to thin some of our forests, so the limited water resources that we have can keep at least some trees alive, but maybe not at the densities that our current forests are at." So Dawson calls for scientists to work more closely with governmental agencies to choose the best environmental strategies, especially when it comes to water.

    <description>Medical students at the University of California, San Francisco, are learning about human anatomy not only on cadavers, but also in virtual reality. This is part of a new pilot curriculum led by anatomy professor Derek Harmon. "The students, as soon as they learn the material on actual cadavers, on skeletons, or in the lab itself, they could go into the space where we had virtual reality set up and they could do the exact same type of lesson, but they could take it piece-by-piece off of the model in the virtual space, which means they could physically walk around the virtual model getting this kind of 360 degree view that they could not get in the lab." This way, even though students can&#x2019;t feel the virtual body, they can explore its every little detail. "You can really quickly see that it helped more with the depth level and by that I mean from the superficial skin level down to the deepest part in the body, because they can take every piece layer-by-layer off." Harmon says in just a couple of years VR's popularity will likely skyrocket among medical doctors.</description>

But researchers like Lenore Pereira of the University of California, San Francisco, in a joint effort with the University of California, Berkeley, sought answers and found two routes used by Zika to make its way to a fetus. "So we were able to isolate human cells from the placenta, and infect them with Zika virus, and show that the virus could replicate in cells that came from the placenta itself or from the fetal membranes. And the virus was very competent in growing and producing more of itself, which means that it could spread inside a placenta and across fetal membranes to infect the baby &#x2013; either directly through the blood or maybe through the skin." Pereira and her team also discovered a protein common to the placental cells that Zika could infect, as well as an antibiotic that could block this interaction.

    <description>Racial issues have been widely discussed by sociologists, anthropologists, artists and filmmakers. Now, medical researchers are chiming in with their expertise. "We&#x2019;re thinking about race in terms of self-identified race and ethnicity, a very specific measure in the context of biomedical research. And we&#x2019;re the first group that&#x2019;s looked at genome-wide molecular signature of race and ethnicity and shown that it differs not for just genetic reasons, but also probably for environmental reasons." That&#x2019;s Noah Zaitlen, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He came to this conclusion with his colleagues while studying asthma rates in different ethnic groups. "It&#x2019;s very high in Puerto Ricans. It&#x2019;s high in African-Americans. It&#x2019;s very low in Mexicans." So Zaitlen wanted to know why. He says if doctors looked not only at these groups&#x2019; genetics, but also at the communities they live in and the air that they breathe, they might have improved their diagnosis and treatments.</description>

    <description>Bacteria and fungi are fingerprints of asthma and allergies, which newborn children could develop later in life. Susan Lynch, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Francisco, tested stool samples of about 300 babies and found that when bacteria and fungi interact, sometimes it changes microbiota and can trigger the diseases. "So this kind of a new technology where it allows us to look at variations in specific genes characteristically found in bacteria and fungi. Variation in those genes will allow us to assess which microbes the genes came from. And in that way, we can get a sense of which bacteria and which fungi are present in the gut of these children". Lynch says this discovery will help researchers advance their testing techniques and predict more precisely if children might become allergic or asthmatic.</description>

    <description>For the first time, a team of scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the University of California, Santa Cruz have successfully 3D-printed ultralight supercapacitors using an aerogel made out of graphene. Lab engineer Chen Zhu explains that this breakthrough opens the door to new, highly efficient energy storage systems for a range of applications, including smartphones, electric cars and implantable devices to name a few. "If you have iPhone in the future, it can store the energy very quickly and release the energy very fast. So it has very wide applications. That&#x2019;s why we are working on this because we want to use a new fabrication technique to fabricate the architectural design of the supercapacitor because currently most of the supercapacitor is a very thin film, just a 2D pattern. So, for the 3D, printing, that will improve the performance of the supercapacitor." Narrator: It will also create unique electronics that are currently difficult or even impossible to make using other synthetic methods. </description>

    <description>Can parents protect their children from developing asthma and eczema? Michael Cabana, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, believes it could be possible if parents follow these recommendations very early in their children&#x2019;s lives, starting from birth. &#x201C;Longer duration of breastfeeding might be helpful, avoiding the use of antibiotics is also important and it seems to be a beneficial effect of vaginal delivery." Cabana&#x2019;s recent study also showed that positive health effects of probiotics might be overstated, despite a widely accepted belief that they help prevent eczema or asthma in kids. Cabana says researchers need to take a closer look at children&#x2019;s microbiota. &#x201C;I think as we develop better tools to understand microbiota and how that microbiota evolves and what is a normal microbiota in a normally developing child I think that is the type of background information we still need to continue and develop."</description>

    <description>Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have discovered that a specific virus called cytomegalovirus, or CMV, could trigger childhood leukemia - a type of cancer that strikes about 15,000 American children each year. &#x201C;We found evidence of this virus at birth and it was found more frequently in children that went on to get leukemia. This virus was found years before diagnosis.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s study leader Adam de Smith, who says CMV could also lead to other diseases. &#x201C;Children born with CMV may have developmental defects and particularly hearing los affected with CMV virus. So it is a pretty big public health issue and one thing that may come out of this research is a potential for a vaccine against CMV virus.&#x201D; While the development of this vaccine has been a priority for American health officials, the process is complicated. So De Smith says a lot more research needs to be done before a vaccine is available.</description>

    <description>We can lose our sense of smell because of a disease, injury, or simply - aging, but doctors don&#x2019;t pay a lot of attention to this problem, according to neuroscientist John Ngai at the University of California, Berkeley. &#x201C;Most people that write to me or call me, and say I've lost a sense of smell and I would ask them, what does your doctor say? And the doctor says no big deal don't worry about it, right? In fact, there aren't even any good, widely-used standardized tests for smell.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s because scientists still don&#x2019;t really know how to repair the olfactory cells responsible for the sense of smell. But Ngai hopes his new research on stem cells could help find answers. &#x201C;Now the challenge is to really start digging in to see, can we actually alter what these cells do. We've identified some pathways and manipulated them genetically, and shown that this can affect how the stem cell behaves in terms of, do I make a neuron? Do I not make a neuron? And then the question is, if I actually do, for example, increase the production of neurons from these stem cells, could it actually overcome an olfactory deficit that's caused by a loss of neurons?&#x201D;</description>

    <description>This week on Science Today. University of California researchers are on the front lines when it comes to figuring out how the Zika virus makes its way to a fetus. Dr. Lenore Pereira of UC San Francisco, worked with UC Berkeley researchers, to show there are two routes used by Zika to make its way to a developing baby. "We were able to isolate human cells from the placenta and infect them with Zika virus and show that the virus could replicate in cells that came from the placenta itself or from the fetal membranes." The team also discovered that an existing antibiotic may be able to limit the damage wreaked by the virus. Meanwhile, UCSF researchers are also looking to keep healthy babies healthier later in life. Epidemiologist Janet Wojcicki discovered a link between breastfeeding and longer telomere length. Telomeres are the protective caps on our DNA and the shorter they are, the more risk of chronic disease. "We know from other studies that breastfeeding has a whole array of benefits, but we don&#x2019;t really know in all cases what that mechanism is and so the fact that it&#x2019;s impacting at the cellular level was very exciting." UC Berkeley chemists are also getting down to the level of neurons to find out just how the nutrient copper mediates conversations between cells. Chris Chang says they&#x2019;ve been studying the interface between metals and neuroscience for a while. "And the thing that we ended up finding was that copper is important for having brain cells communicate with each other normally." Don&#x2019;t miss the latest University of California research news.

    <description>Smarter T-cells that can effectively fight cancer may be the key to successful immunotherapy. Molecular scientist Wendell Lim of the University of California, San Francisco, has engineered synthetic receptors, called syn-Notch receptors, that can not only recognize tumors, but also produce molecules that can suppress cancerous microenvironments in the body. "The syn-Notch receptors are kind of a universal sensing platform that allows us to program the T-cells with many kinds of input/output responses. So it really allows us to treat the T-cell much like the way you would program a robot that can sense whether there are obstacles in front of it." Lim says scientists are testing these highly efficient multi-pronged T-cells in labs, but they may be available for patients within the next couple of years. "I think we can really transform what cancer therapy is like." Lim also hopes that smart T-cells will target cancers that can&#x2019;t currently be treated with immunotherapy.</description>

    <description>Hi there &#x2013; just catching up with the weekly roundup after a bit of a break. The show did go on, so here are some of the stories covered. First, did you know that heart disease is the leading cause of death among American women? Now, researcher Nisha Parikh of UC San Francisco has found that the age a woman is when she reaches menopause affects her risk of developing heart disease. "We found that a longer reproductive period duration was actually associated with less of a risk of heart failure, and that was mostly driven by the age of menopause, so that having an earlier age at menopause was associated with a higher risk of heart failure." But researchers still don&#x2019;t know what causes it and are working on further studies to find answers. Meanwhile, across the Bay at UC Berkeley, physicist Jeffrey Neaton is looking to Mother Nature to improve energy production skills. In particular, he&#x2019;s working on making photosynthesis more efficient. "A leaf can convert the energy in sunlight into fuel with a one to two percent efficiency. A major Department of Energy program that I&#x2019;m part of, the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, recently developed a prototype material that is made of semiconductors that can go from sunlight to fuel at 10 percent efficiency. Much greater efficiency than plants, actually." So, Neaton is working on creating an artificial leaf that could someday generate fuel and become a new alternative energy source. And finally, we learned something new about our lungs. They don&#x2019;t just pump air in and out of our bodies &#x2013; they make blood cells, too. "The lung is quite sophisticated, not just respiring, moving oxygen. Around 50 percent or more of platelets are produced directly in the lung." That&#x2019;s Mark Looney, a professor of medicine at UCSF. He explains that since platelets are components that make our blood clot, and it used to be thought were formed only in the bone marrow, this new finding will have significant clinical implications. So, that&#x2019;s it for now. But there&#x2019;s plenty more research stories at the University of California, so please subscribe to Science Today on iTunes or follow us on Soundcloud to keep updated.

    <description>Researchers at the University of California, Berkley, are competing with Mother Nature to improve energy production skills. In particular, physicist Jeffrey Neaton is working on making photosynthesis more efficient. &#x201C;A leaf can convert the energy in sun light into fuel with a one to two percent efficiency. A major Department of Energy program that I&#x2019;m part of, the joint center for artificial photosynthesis, has recently developed a prototype material that is made of semiconductors that can go from sunlight to fuel at 10 percent efficiency. Much greater efficiency than plants, actually&#x201D;. Neaton is working on an artificial leaf that could generate fuel and can someday become a new alternative energy source. &#x201C;Right now the artificial leaf prototypes are not made of materials that are cheap enough or abandoned enough to be saleable to a level where they will impact society yet.&#x201D; But technology moves forward fast. Take solar panels, for example. In just 10 years, the price of this energy source has fallen by over 60 percent. So, we may want to use an artificial leaf sooner than we think. For Science Today, I&#x2019;m Larissa Branin. Time: a little over. The 1st bite can be trimmed I think. Last sentence, in Italic.</description>

    <description>Several American cities have approved ballot measures in favor of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages. Public health expert Kristine Madsen of the University of California, Berkeley explains how smoking and a subsequent tobacco tax set a precedent for the more recent sugar-sweetened beverage taxes. "So, tobacco and the taxes on tobacco are a great analogy when we&#x2019;re just talking about something like sugar-sweetened beverages because it&#x2019;s a luxury. It&#x2019;s a little bit like a luxury tax on alcohol or cigarettes. That&#x2019;s your choice &#x2013; that&#x2019;s fine, but clearly it should only happen occasionally." There&#x2019;s also the public perception &#x2013; smoking is not considered as &#x2018;cool&#x2019; as it used to be in popular ads and culture. Currently, that&#x2019;s not the case with many sugar-sweetened beverages. "You&#x2019;ve got all these athletes who are doing it and so it looks cool, so I think that would be a huge win if there was a shift in the population away from thinking that was a good drink." Madsen&#x2019;s preliminary research has found that a &#x2018;soda tax&#x2019; could have a really big impact on consumption.</description>

    <description>More than a third of American adults are obese. Experts often call it an epidemic and have long been struggling to find ways to fight obesity. &#x201C;Knowledge is definitely a great way to combat that. That&#x2019;s what happened with cigarette smoking when it became obvious this is going to be detrimental. Are we at that stage yet, I don&#x2019;t think so. We are still going to have an epidemic and people are still becoming more and more obese. And it is a problem and we need to find solutions." That&#x2019;s Andrew Dillin, a molecular biologist of the University of California, Berkeley. He is looking into the possibility of defeating obesity with our - nose. &#x201C;Can we actually go through human population, the obese people and actually test their sense of smell? Maybe we can stratify the obese population, attenuating their sense of smell may be very beneficial." This hypothesis is based on Dillin&#x2019;s recent study. It showed that lab animals without a sense of smell were not gaining extra weight and were losing excessive pounds. Dillin hopes scientists could soon test if this could also work in humans.</description>

We visit Monica Moya at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to find out more about how she created 3D bioprints of a vasculature system using natural &#x2018;bioinks'. "So one of our inks is made out of the same stuff that you find in a blood clot. And we intentionally do this because we are in a sense, are co-engineering with the cells." Given this this ability to print vasculature, the feasibility of 3D printable organs doesn&#x2019;t seem so farfetched anymore. On a somewhat related note, we next take a look at organoids, or miniature lab models that mimic the physiology of real organs. These systems are helping researchers in their quest to learn as much as possible about Zika virus. Finding a good lab model has been challenging, so UC San Francisco's Arnold Kriegstein and his colleagues are stepping in to examine the options. "We were looking at what other model systems could be used to study how the Zika virus infects cells". And we sort of went out on a limb for this last one. Nadav Ahituv of UCSF tells us about how novel genes associated with limb development in bats may help us understand how our own arms and legs grow. "So when our limbs grow, we basically have webbing between them, and then that webbing sort of dies, but in the bat forelimbs, that webbing remains and makes part of the wing."

    <description>A lot of very aggressive forms of cancer seem to metastasize to the bone. Now, researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and University of California campuses at Merced and Davis have joined forces to figure out what&#x2019;s going on in the bone microenvironment between cancer cells and bone cells. Gabriela Loots, a biomedical scientist at the Livermore Lab, says they&#x2019;re onto something. "There are certain molecules, for example, that once secreted by the bone they seem to create this environment that&#x2019;s very attractive to the cancer cells to go there and to grow." Loots and her team are studying prostate cancer in particular because the aggressive form of the disease spreads primarily to the skeleton. They&#x2019;ve identified a bone protein called Sclerostin, which had an inhibitory effect on prostate cancer invasion. "So, basically our next step now is really trying to understand how we can manipulate the environment of the tumor, so we can prevent it from forming bone metastases."</description>

    <description>If alcohol was not as readily available, would people's hearts be healthier? To find out, cardiologist Gregory Marcus of the University of California, San Francisco, looked to the state of Texas. "We leveraged the fact that in Texas some counties don't allow access to alcohol, at least purchase of alcohol, and others counties do." Since alcohol consumption is linked to cardiovascular disease, Marcus wanted to see if being in a dry county would affect the number of atrial fibrillation cases. This is the most common abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause stroke. "And what we found in wet counties, meaning where there was no restriction on alcohol sale, that the prevalence and development of atrial fibrillation was more common than in the counties that prohibited sales of alcohol. At the same time we found that those wet counties also had less heart attacks or less myocardial infractions." Marcus&#x2019; findings show that different people respond differently to alcohol. So if you&#x2019;re wondering if your heart would benefit from moderate drinking, you should first find out if you&#x2019;re at risk of developing heart disease.</description>

    <description>Being called a daydreamer, especially as an adult, often has negative connotations. But researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have been studying the value of what they call &#x2018;mind wandering&#x2019;. Jonathan Schooler, a professor of psychological and brain sciences has been looking specifically at creative scientists and creative writers to see when they have creative ideas. "What we found is that in both of these groups, about a third of their ideas happened while they&#x2019;re mind wandering. And interestingly, we found although overall they don&#x2019;t find their ideas that they had while mind wandering any more creative than the ones that they had at work, they&#x2019;re no less. And in many ways, that&#x2019;s pretty striking, too. If the idea that you have, you know, while gardening is good as the one that you have at your desk, that tells me something. But we also find that the ideas that they have when they&#x2019;re mind wandering are more likely to be an &#x2018;Ah-ha!&#x2019; kind of solution. Something where they really were not expecting it and more likely to involve overcoming an impasse." So the next time someone knocks you for being caught in a daydream, let them know &#x2013; your brain needs this break.</description>

    <description>Advanced image-capturing technology for MRI scanners paired with powerful computers, allow researchers to quickly detect and analyze the smallest changes in brain function after a concussion. Radiologist Pratik Mukherjee of the University of California, San Francisco explains how it works. &#x201C;With the latest technology that we are starting to apply, we can actually get several images of the brain within one second. So we can image the entire brain in less than a second. And we do it continually during the scan for many minutes so we are getting thousands, even tens of thousands images of the brain, which are snapshots over time of function in the brain and the way different brain regions connected to each other.&#x201D; In the late 1990s, it used to take the whole day to process much smaller amount of data with the best computers scientists had at the time. &#x201C;Now we can do the statistics within seconds. So as we are doing the scan, we can start getting the information we need.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Sleep disorders during pregnancy can lead to a preterm birth. To improve sleeping patterns of mothers-to-be, Jennifer Felder, a clinical psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco, is running an intervention research. &#x201C;So we are doing a research on expecting moms and it is a digital intervention for sleep during pregnancies, so we are able to recruit women across the nation and in Canada. So we are hoping to have a really broad reach with that." Besides pre-term birth outcomes, Insomnia is linked to other problems in pregnant women. &#x201C;Poor sleep during pregnancy may also increase risk of perinatal depression and there are some data that suggests that it might increase risk of suicidal ideation, gestational diabetes, cesarean section births. So it does appear to have really broad consequences both psychologically and physically." Treating sleep disorders might help reduce the rate of pre-term births, which affect 1 in 10 women in the United States.</description>

    <description>If family caregivers for dementia patients become depressed, they may not be able to give their disease-stricken loved ones the full attention that they need. And this may even contribute to the patient&#x2019;s earlier death. This, according to Robert Levenson, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley. &#x201C;If you are not able to bring your A game to caregiving, the whole quality of caregiving might suffer. As caregivers get more depressed, their level of the stress sort of permeates the entire household. It might be almost contagious in a way that a virus would be contagious. But this would be a psychological virus." But there might be a different explanation for this dynamic, what Levenson calls - reverse causation. &#x201C;And that is even if we measure depression many, many years before the death of the patients, it may be that if the patients destined to die early, they are already more difficult for caregivers to care for. So their decline may have been causing some of that depression.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>The lungs don&#x2019;t just pump air in and out of our bodies, they also make blood cells. &#x201C;A lung is quite sophisticated, not just respiring, moving oxygen. About 50 percent of platelets are produced directly in the lungs.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s Mark Looney, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He says platelets are components that make our blood clot. Scientists used to think that they get formed only in the bone marrow. So this new finding will have an important clinical implication. &#x201C;The dogma in the field for patients with low platelets count is that it is a problem with the bone marrow. Now we have a more nuanced understanding that that is not just cells in that location, but lung is a significant contributor to that. Now with the more complete understanding hopefully we will be able to develop approaches that can more effectively treat these patients.&#x201D;</description>

    <description>Can economic hardship shape the way our brain works? For 25 years, Kristine Yaffe, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco followed more than three thousand adults with different income levels and found that poverty does affect cognitive function. She says this is due to a concept called &#x2018;cognitive reserve&#x2019;. "And what that means is the more you can grow your brain, the more you have education -- the more it is stimulated, the more complex your occupation is, the more complex your lifestyle activities are - your leisure activities." Yaffe says with that in mind, researchers can prevent cognitive diseases later in life. "Using your brain in this way, we think may have a beneficial effect in terms of protecting against getting dementia and other kinds of processes that affect your memory and thinking."</description>

    <description>Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, affects over two million people worldwide. The neurodegenerative disease strikes when the immune system attacks myelin, layers of a fatty insulating membrane that surround nerve fibers and help send nerve signals faster. Ari Green, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, has found an over the counter allergy drug called Clemastine that could possibly help repair damaged myelin. &#x201C;It was originally designed back in the 1970s as an antihistamine and we were excited that it showed the evidence that myelin repair is possible even with injury that is not immediate or acute, but has been there for some time." Green says because of possible side effects of the medication, Clemastine is only a prototype for a better myelin repairing drug that researchers have yet to develop. "What we want is a drug that has a very targeted effect that would be capable of inducing this repair without causing other side effects."</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jon Ronson, the creator of Audible Original&#xA0;&lt;em&gt;The Butterfly Effect&lt;/em&gt;, delves into the pornography industry again as he unravels the never-before-told story of what caused a beloved 23-year-old actress&#x2019;s untimely death.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In December 2017, famed adult film star August Ames died by suicide in a park in the Conejo Valley. Her death came just a day after she&#x2019;d been the victim of a social media pile-on by fellow porn professionals&#x2014;punishment for her tweeting out something deemed homophobic.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A month later, August&#x2019;s husband and pornography producer Kevin Moore connected with journalist Jon Ronson to tell the story of how cyberbullying via Twitter killed his wife. Neither of them could predict the rumors and secrets that Ronson would soon hear, revelations that hinted at a very different story&#x2014;something mysterious and unexpected and terrible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jon travels to California&#x2019;s San Fernando Valley, where most of the world&#x2019;s porn is made. There he finds pornographers with lives upended by Fabian&#x2019;s business plan. But it isn&#x2019;t long before Jon discovers something extraordinary: a community within the porn world fighting back by embarking on a very strange enterprise &#x2013; pornography written, filmed, and performed for an audience of one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This week on Britain&#x2019;s best Brexit podcast: Theresa May literally chokes on her words in &#x201C;a grand moment of political education for the Conservative Party at large&#x201D; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;but what does it mean? Plus stand-up comic and special guest AHIR SHAH tries to make sense of Brexit. The EU and the Catalonia crisis. And is the economy getting worse or do we just think it is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus Sue Wilson of pro-EU group for UK citizens abroad BREMAIN IN SPAIN tells us how most Britons who live in another country are far from the &#x201C;Brexit Brits&#x201D; of stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;How could we have MERKED ourselves so completely?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to help us #OwnTheRemoan?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;SPEED RELEASE TO KEEP UP WITH EVENTS: As Parliament delivers &#x201C;a masterclass in cowardice&#x201D; on the Withdrawal Bill and the May Government escapes into a world of pure imagination, &lt;strong&gt;Ros Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ian Dunt&lt;/strong&gt; and new panelist &lt;strong&gt;Melissa Chemam&lt;/strong&gt; convene to sift the wreckage of Amendment Day. If MPs don&#x2019;t want No Deal, why did they rob themselves of the chance to prevent it? Why is May going to Brussels to ask questions the answers to which she knows are &#x201C;no&#x201D;? And what the hell happens next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus we welcome our very first Leaver guest&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Oliver Norgrove&lt;/strong&gt; to Remainiacs. How did leaving the EU mutate from a serious intellectual position into a destructive and unforgiving religion? When exactly did this Leave enthusiast lose faith in the cause? And how does someone from the other side of the fence think we can undo the damage done by the past two years? It&#x2019;s a fascinating conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;There&#x2019;s going to be ire for the liars.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s podcast is presented by Ros Taylor with Nina Schick, Melissa Chemam and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s inefficient Euro-socialist overmanning time as we present a special, super-extended episode of Remainiacs with not one but TWO special guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First the fantastic &lt;strong&gt;FEMI OLUWOLE&lt;/strong&gt; of youth campaign &lt;a href="https://www.ofoc.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Our Future Our Choice&lt;/a&gt; tells us why he gave up a promising career to fight Brexit, how young people are the ones who can turn this mess around&#x2026; and why everyone turns into a worse version of themselves on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the legend that is &lt;strong&gt;BILLY BRAGG&lt;/strong&gt; comes in to explain some hard truths about the working class concerns that led to Brexit, why we should be making the case to remain and reform&#x2026; and play us some tunes from his current album &lt;a href="http://billybragg.co.uk/bridgesnotwalls/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&#x2019;Bridges Not Walls&#x2019;&lt;/a&gt; too. Hold tight for one-off renditions of &#x2018;England, Half English&#x2019; and (yes) &#x2019;Full English Brexit&#x2019;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: The latest round-up of Theresa May&#x2019;s miserable performance on the Customs Union and Windrush. Is Thanos from &#x2018;Avengers: Infinity War&#x2019; really a Brexiter? And should we be listening to the legitimate concerts of voters in &lt;strong&gt;Ward/Area&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got to remember that Leavers voted to make the country better too.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;THE MARCH THEY CAN&#x2019;T IGNORE: In the wake of the epic 700,000-strong People&#x2019;s Vote March we ask where next for the campaign for a Final Say referendum? And Observer columnist and Alpha Centrist Dad &lt;strong&gt;NICK COHEN&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to talk over the long game in the Tories&#x2019; endless fratricidal war, why the Referendum provoked &#x201C;the greatest outbreak of political lying in a hundred years,&#x201D; Chris Grayling&#x2019;s new career as a ferrymaster, and why the Brexit jihadis will &#x201C;burn down the house for the sake of their idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingrid Oliver and Naomi Smith are your panelists while Dorian Lynskey is back from writing some book or other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;Whatever you find hard to imagine, IMAGINE IT.&#x201D; &#x2013; Nick Cohen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ingrid Oliver and Naomi Smith.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the podcast for rebels and mutineers&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;NICK CLEGG joins Dorian, Peter and special guest MIRANDA SAWYER in the Remainiacs bunker for a full-on remoan-a-thon that&#x2019;s full of optimism and ideas for the future. Can we actually STOP Brexit, and if so how? May&#x2019;s Big Deal: how much devil is in the detail? (Clue: loads) Does Nick blame himself for the austerity that led to the Brexit revolt? And are he and Cameron still carrying on their bromance on the downlow?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Will the seismic trauma of COVID-19 provide the moment of clarity we need to change the way we live? Authoritarian governments seize on Corona to enact the repressive moves they&#x2019;ve always craved. &lt;strong&gt;Chemicals and ventilators:&lt;/strong&gt; is the Government&#x2019;s slipperiness with facts undermining its Corona message? Transition denialism drags us towards the abyss. And our special guest, former Labour MP for Bury &lt;strong&gt;James Frith&lt;/strong&gt;, give his totally disinterested take on the arrival of the Starminator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;There IS a money tree &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;and it isn&#x2019;t magic. It is sensible to spend money when you need to.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt; &#x2013; Ian Dunt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;There will be an upside to this crisis if it makes us confront the changes we need to make in society and in work&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;It could force a welcome change.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt; &#x2013; James Frith&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;You hear people saying don&#x2019;t question the police, it&#x2019;s an emergency, don&#x2019;t complain&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;That is precisely the opposite to the approach we should be taking.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt; &#x2013; Ian Dunt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ian Dunt and Ros Taylor.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, the last desperate moves before next week&#x2019;s descent in the Hellmouth of Final Votes. Has Theresa May&#x2019;s attempts to &lt;strong&gt;bribe Labour MPs&lt;/strong&gt; from Leave constituencies backfired? Just how wobbly is &lt;strong&gt;Labour&#x2019;s &#x201C;commitment&#x201D; to a People&#x2019;s Vote&lt;/strong&gt;? And who will run candidates in the &lt;strong&gt;2019 European Parliamentary Elections&lt;/strong&gt; if Brexit is extended and Britain has to participate?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus! While parliament wrestles with procedure, our panelists choose the real &lt;strong&gt;elephants in the room&lt;/strong&gt; that nobody is talking about. Which Leave leaders would we turn and use their powers for good if we could? The loopiness of &lt;strong&gt;Ladies for Leave&lt;/strong&gt;. And how did Bristol&#x2019;s Massive Attack predict Brexit?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Naomi Smith with Ingrid Oliver, Ros Taylor and Melissa Chemam.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As the EU Election clock ticks remorselessly down to zero we&#x2019;re joined by the New Statesman&#x2019;s political editor &lt;strong&gt;STEPHEN BUSH&lt;/strong&gt; to survey the campaign so far and predict the upshot. What will Labour&#x2019;s &#x201C;all things to everyone&#x201D; stance to do its vote? How do we fight the Brexit Party&#x2019;s &#x201C;all rage, no content&#x2019;&#x2019; politics? Just how screwed are the Conservatives? Why a Farage victory might be a good thing for Remain. And we (try to) answer the only question that matters: &lt;strong&gt;who should Remainers vote for?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS Why the media&#x2019;s middle class cringe gets Leave politicians off the hook. A first-ever Brexit football analogy for Remainiacs (plus some shocking anti-Spurs bias) from grieving Arsenal fanatic Stephen Bush. How CHUK failed to a make even a first impression. And why are we ignoring Clarabell who runs a recycling centre in Brighton?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;First you create the humiliation. Then you just seed that humiliation and benefit from it. That&#x2019;s what Farage has always done.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Nina Schick and Ian Dunt. Produced by Andrew Harrison. Audio production is by Sophie Black. Recorded by Tom Bullen at Air Edel Studios, London. &lt;strong&gt;Remainiacs is a Podmasters production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get every new episode of Remainiacs a whole day early when you &lt;a href="http://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;back us on the&amp;nbsp;Patreon crowdfunding platform&lt;/a&gt;.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week in Euro-Plague news: How is Sweden&#x2019;s risky approach to the COVID crisis really working? &lt;strong&gt;James Savage&lt;/strong&gt; of news network &lt;a href="https://www.thelocal.se/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;The Local&lt;/a&gt; joins us from Stockholm to give us the view on the ground. Plus: That weird feeling when the person demanding a proper merciless lockdown is&#x2026; evil &lt;strong&gt;Dominic Cummings&lt;/strong&gt;? Alan Sugar&#x2019;s totalitarian boomer tweets. And why we shouldn&#x2019;t trust people who say we don&#x2019;t trust journalists.

And they are hoping to take advantage of that.&lt;/em&gt;&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;strong&gt;Ros Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;They&#x2019;ve created the idea that they&#x2019;re fighting a sentient enemy&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;because the alternative is to admit that our government was outwitted by goo.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt; &#x2013; &lt;strong&gt;Alex Andreou&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week: Why Dominic Cummings is putting out information chaff to create the impression of activity. Which good Remainy cause are YOU going to donate your shiny Brexit 50p to? Would Paddington Bear be rejected for Settled Status? Why are the Brexiters placing their faith in the WTO &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Trump just as Trump is trying to neuter the WTO itself? And your autumn timetable of what (not) to worry about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;This Government is exactly like Brexit Twitter. And it behaves like Brexit Twitter.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Alex Andreou, Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The flaming wreckage of The Deal is all around us (yet again) but what happens next? Can Theresa May salvage anything from her plans and career? Is there enough turd polish around to give the Deal another go-round? What even is Malthouse 2.0? And is it democratically necessary to give the people the option to vote for catastrophe?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our special guests are LAYLA MORAN MP &#x2013; Lib Dem Education spokesman and indefatigable People&#x2019;s Vote warrior &#x2013; and our brother-in podcasting TIM MCINERNEY of the brilliant Irish Passport podcast (theirishpassport.com).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen in as Layla gives us fascinating insights into what it&#x2019;s like to vote as an MP on such a momentous day as Tuesday. And Tim tells us what English people just do not get about the Anglo-Irish relationship &#x2013; and what could happen if we No Deal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and there may well be an Emergency Podcast later in the week. Who knows? We don&#x2019;t. Theresa May doesn&#x2019;t. NOBODY KNOWS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;This is 100% full-spectrum wrong. You cannot get more wrong than this.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey, Nina Schick and Ian Dunt. Produced by Andrew Harrison.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As MV3 turns out to be DOA we hotfoot it into febrile Soho to read the steaming entrails of the May Deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens next? Does May have any blackmail left in her sack of off-brand tricks? What will happen at the EU Parent-Teacher meeting on April 10? Are we closer to Revoke or a People&#x2019;s Vote? Michael Gove&#x2019;s performative jogging, the political significance of Y-fronts, and the Magic 8 Ball that is a possible General Election. And how could Theresa May&#x2019;s psychology finally scupper us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naomi Smith has gin. Dorian Lynskey has Lem-Sip. Alex Andreou has the healthy glow of a man who&#x2019;s been in Mykonos since February. Come on in, the recriminations are fine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#RevokeFifticle&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks to Will Fitzpatrick and the Soho Radio crew for sorting out the studio at short notice.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photoshop: Stuart Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;They put tweets that Brexiters would rather forget on giant billboards, chased Farage around the country with reminders of his lies, and annoyed loony-right glove puppet Guido Fawkes so much he outed them for spite. Now guerrilla artists and Remainiac heroes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ByDonkeys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;LED BY DONKEYS&lt;/a&gt; join us on the podcast to tell us what it&#x2019;s like when an idea in the pub goes on to the country alight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Stewart and Olly Knowles from LBD tell us who deserves a proper lampooning (and who doesn&#x2019;t), why the British will accept anything from a man in a hi-viz jacket&#x2026; and how they used their own brand of street theatre to hack the media, the political system and the brain of Britain itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Why we need to stop calling it &#x2018;prorogation&#x2019; and call it an executive coup instead. The March of the Mini-Hoeys. &lt;strong&gt;The dawn of Brexit Stalinism&lt;/strong&gt;&#x2026; or is it Stalinist Brexit? Nina destroys the argument that we have to leave the EU to trade freely in a hot minute. And why there are only effectively nine working days to stop No Deal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The only thing that needs to happen for No Deal to occur is&#x2026; nothing.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the podcast that literally cannot believe what it&#x2019;s seeing&#x2026; How in the hell is David Davis still in post after admitting that the secret Brexit assessments, which he said were &#x201C;exhaustive&#x201D;, DO NOT EVEN EXIST? Meanwhile it emerges that the Government has NO IDEA of the shape of the final Brexit that it wants. They simply have not discussed it. How is this happening? Why is this OK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: D&#xC1;IL OR NO D&#xC1;IL? The Irish border mess (how long ago it seems now). Special guest Eloise Todd of Best For Britain on what you can do to beat back Brexit. And Naomi&#x2019;s scarily accurate Arlene Foster impersonation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;The Government has managed to take Britain BEYOND HUMILIATION.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help us to #OwnTheRemoan!

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the Brexit podcast that refuses to get over it&#x2026; Special guest DR MIKE GALSWORTHY of http://scientistsforeu.uk rails against the self-destructive waste of Britain&#x2019;s departure from European science collaboration. And he tells us why Britain leaving the nuclear oversight authority Euratom is a really, really stupid idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus Bregret intensifies as latest polling says Remain would win by 54% to 46% if a referendum were held tomorrow. Michael Gove weaponises the Great British Fish to satisfy &#x201C;the emotional delinquency of a bunch of Brexit headbangers.&#x201D; And Peter Collins asks &#x201C;whatever happened to Fields Of The Nephilim?&#x201D; Destroyed by the Common Agricultural Policy, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Brexit is broken.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Plan A arrives in its moustache and glasses, will May&#x2019;s second attempt to get a deal through unbalance the Brexit Bus and if so, in which direction?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;With less than two weeks to go, how is this simultaneously the most terrifying and consequential &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;yet somehow boring &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;General Election in history? Even with the Conservatives looking to stack every aspect of the constitution permanently in government&#x2019;s favour?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: what the party leaders&#x2019; stock reactions to the London Bridge terror attack reveal about how they see the electorate. Did Labour&#x2019;s leaks about NHS privatisation come from Russian hackers? WTF is an Australian points-based immigration system anyway and where does performative nastiness figure in the mass psychology of politics?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long to go now, Britain. It&#x2019;ll all be over soon. And then it&#x2019;ll start up again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented and produced by Andrew Harrison with Ian Dunt, Ingrid Oliver and Dorian Lynskey.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the only Brexit podcast with an EU Blue Flag for cleanliness&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;Is David Davis&#x2019;s negotiation team really lulling Brussels into a false sense of security or are they genuinely inept?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Britain registers the worst COVID toll in Europe, why is blame for the failure sliding off Boris Johnson? Lovelorn Prof Neil Ferguson feels the sap rising. Operation Bookshelf Barbarossa. Why VE Day belongs to us, not the petty nationalists. Is the fish a credible war animal? And who decided that if you&#x2019;re pro-Brexit you&#x2019;ve got to be pro-virus too? &lt;strong&gt;Dorian Lynskey&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Naomi Smith&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ian Dunt&lt;/strong&gt; police one another&#x2019;s tones.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;People are saying this is not the time to criticise the government.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Labour&#x2019;s Deputy Leader in Brussels &lt;strong&gt;SEB DANCE MEP&lt;/strong&gt; joins us in the Remainiacs Bunker to discuss the Government&#x2019;s &#x2018;technical notices&#x2019; and why they may be saving the worst for last&#x2026; what life in Brussels is like for British MEPs now that we as a country have roundly insulted their colleagues&#x2026; and why the next Tory Prime Minister could well be someone you&#x2019;ve never even heard of (they might even be listening to this show).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Seb talks about the biggest question of all. What will it take to shift the Labour leadership on Brexit? &#x201C;If Labour has as its ethos the democratisation of the party,&#x201D; says Seb Dance, &#x201C;Then it can&#x2019;t ignore the biggest issue for its membership.&#x201D; Follow him on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SebDance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Can that &lt;a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/002/public/#/initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;European Citizens&#x2019; Initiative&lt;/a&gt; really give us permanent EU citizenship &#x2013; even if Britain leaves the EU? Why Stalin and Hitler hated Esperanto. The return of &lt;strong&gt;#ButYourEmails&lt;/strong&gt;. And a surprise announcement for our beloved Patreon backers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Silly season? We&#x2019;ve been in the silly season for 24 months&#x2026;&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Alex Andreou and Ian Dunt.

Should we embrace or fear a vote that Theresa May definitely doesn&#x2019;t want? Can Remain parties co-ordinate, which side&#x2019;s vote is most likely to split&#x2026; and how does the D&#x2019;Hondt system work anyway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus how can a fatally split Tory party fight EU elections AND a leadership campaign AND negotiate with Brussels AND get Labour onside when they can&#x2019;t even do one thing at a time let alone four? Alex gets glued to a train by a passing Brexiter and turns up late. Matt&#x2019;s terrifyingly accurate William Hague and Tony Blair voices. And how would our guest&#x2019;s beloved Brian Clough have handled Brexit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;This is our chance to do a Ukip.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECORDED FROM SECRET BUNKERS ACROSS EUROPE&#x2026;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;As the Corona Crisis deepens, is the Government blowing its response? Will Fortress Britain have to request an extension to our transition out of EU arrangements? Guest &lt;strong&gt;Mike Galsworthy&lt;/strong&gt; of Scientists 4 EU tells us what&#x2019;s really going on with the science of the COVID battle. Plus, the truth about Dominic Cummings&#x2019; secret science army. The heroic return of Our Man in Mykonos &lt;strong&gt;Alex Andreou&lt;/strong&gt;, if only in a virtual context. And top tips for working from home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please forgive our wayward sound quality. We&#x2019;re recording in rooms spread across London (and in the Cycladic Islands&#x2026;). Remainiacs is on lockdown. What else is new?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;If you keep electing people whose explicit aim is to atrophy the State, you can&#x2019;t complain when the State can&#x2019;t spring into action when you need it.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt; &#x2013; Alex Andreou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Dominic Cummings clearly loves science &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;but he&#x2019;s hurting the thing he loves.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; Mike Galsworthy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ros Taylor with Naomi Smith and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on Britain&#x2019;s last-ever European Podcast of Culture&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;What did David Davis hope to achieve by redacting the Government&#x2019;s 58 secret Impact Papers? Why did DExEU spin doctors harass journalists for even saying the papers even existed &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;when now we know they did all along?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: The Government caves on the EU divorce bill, as everyone knew they would. What sort of final Brexit settlement would the Remainiacs team like to see? Daniel Hannan&#x2019;s sci-fi Brexit. Biblical Leavers vs High-Stakes Remainers. And where to plant a Magic Money Tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Whatever the Brexiters want, we&#x2019;re going to be paying pensions until literally everybody dies.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to help us #OwnTheRemoan?

Plus: how on earth did shady contrarian factory &lt;strong&gt;Spiked&lt;/strong&gt; elbow its way into the spotlight of politics, and are they really as influential as TV producers think? And British satellites. &lt;a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2020/06/30/uks-rival-to-galileo-a-brexit-farce/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Galileo? Galileo.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;REMOTELY RECORDED FOR YOUR HYGIENE&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;Has the deepening Corona crisis rendered the Brexiteers&#x2019; plans for economic nirvana obsolete? Why the EU&#x2019;s big financial guns are coming out.&amp;nbsp;Special guest &lt;strong&gt;Charlotte Potts&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;London political correspondent for Deutsche Welle &#x2013; tells us what Germany thinks of Britain&#x2019;s efforts on transition, Johnson&#x2019;s wayward handling of COVID-19&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;and Angela Merkel&#x2019;s unexpected last stand. And have the Brexit years created a &lt;strong&gt;hysterical media&lt;/strong&gt; that&#x2019;s no longer fit to cover a real emergency?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The people who&#x2019;ve spent the last five years calling everyone a snowflake had a meltdown on day one of the pubs being closed.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;EMERGENCY RELEASE AS EVENTS GO CRAZY YET AGAIN. The dam finally breaks in the most dramatic week in Brexit since&#x2026; January? Eight Labour MPs including Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna quit Labour over anti-semitism and Corbyn&#x2019;s intransigence over Brexit. Then three Tory women &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;Heidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Woollaston &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;resign from the party they now say is irrevocably dominated by the hard Right and its ERG extremists. What can &lt;strong&gt;the Independent Group&lt;/strong&gt; achieve and what must they do to achieve it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Honda, Nissan and industry&#x2019;s fear of the &#x201C;B&#x201D; word. Why you need to be at the &lt;a href="https://www.peoples-vote.uk/march" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put It To The People March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday 23 March. And what&#x2019;s driving older people&#x2019;s resentment of the young? TalkRadio presenter &lt;strong&gt;Cristo Foufas&lt;/strong&gt; joins our regulars to thrash it all out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Naomi Smith with Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Did Andrew Marr fail to land a punch on Arron Banks? Should Leave EU&#x2019;s troubled Alpha Gammon have been invited on a BBC politics programme at all? What does it mean for Labour now that Momentum members have come out for a People&#x2019;s Vote? Will Labour&#x2019;s Barry Gardiner ever recover from the &#x201C;reveal&#x201D; of that massive C4 poll that showed a firm shift to Remain across the country &#x2013; and what does Ian really think of &#x201C;Eyeroll Girl&#x201D;?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS &lt;strong&gt;Ruth Fox of the Hansard Society&lt;/strong&gt; drops in to explain just how messy the Government&#x2019;s use of &#x201C;Henry VIII&#x201D; Statutory instruments has become (spoiler: they have almost no time left to do what they need to do). And she unpicks the Parliamentary practicalities of a People&#x2019;s Vote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a reason why ministers always go on Marr. It&#x2019;s because they get an easy ride.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ian Dunt and Naomi Smith. Audio production: Sophie Black.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Attention, bots, trolls and rogue A.I.s! This week our own &lt;strong&gt;Nina Schick&lt;/strong&gt; publishes her new book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Fakes-Infocalypse-What-Urgently/dp/1913183521/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=NINA+SCHICK&amp;amp;qid=1596632924&amp;amp;sr=8-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Deep Fakes and the Infocalypse: What You Urgently Need To Know&lt;/a&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;and its revelations about how high technology can create terrifyingly plausible fake humans in video or audio, for political ends, will scare the hell out of you. What can we do to stop bad actors from Russia, China and elsewhere from bringing about the &lt;strong&gt;literal collapse of consensual reality&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: The &lt;strong&gt;Brexit Drain to Spain&lt;/strong&gt;.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;How did a sweeping local elections vote for Remain parties become an instruction to &#x201C;just get Brexit done&#x201D;? What do those results mean for the EU Elections later this month? What will it take to stop the momentum of the Brexit Party? And what will happen if we don&#x2019;t?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEX SOBEL&lt;/strong&gt;, the pro-People&#x2019;s Vote Labour MP for Leeds North West, joins us to unpick the spin around a vote that saw both Labour and the Tories receive a bloody nose &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;and then try to explain it away. He gives us an idea of what Labour&#x2019;s &#x201C;all things to everyone&#x201D; position looks like from the inside, spells out the red lines for Labour&#x2019;s growing Confirmation Vote movement&#x2026; and tells what Britain needs to do about the catastrophic issues we&#x2019;re neglecting because of the endless, endless Brexit War.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Tommy Robinson?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Very excited to welcome legendary food journalist and Observer restaurant critic JAY RAYNER for the eye-opening, jaw-dropping hard truths of Britain&#x2019;s Brexitised food policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we really only days away from empty shelves in the event of Hard Brexit? Why is our food culture still shaped by the effects of WWII? Which parts of EU food policy ARE a disaster (that we won&#x2019;t be able to influence once we leave)? And did you know that it&#x2019;s now OK to eat cod, and climate change has produced a huge increase in availability of fish in the Baring Sea&#x2026;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Corbyn&#x2019;s &#x201C;cheap imported labour&#x201D; muddle &#x2013; Peter explains what the European Posted Workers Directive really entails. Did you know that British spy Christopher Steele who wrote the Trump dossier also conducted the inquiry into the Litvenenko murder? What does THAT mean? And we go nuts for BBC Northern Ireland&#x2019;s spoof Brexumentary &#x2018;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09tnc2x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Soft Border Force&lt;/a&gt;&#x2019; (have YOU had the Ebola?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;There might be so little to eat that you&#x2019;ll be GLAD of chlorine chicken&#x2026;&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Peter Collins.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s a big one. TONY BLAIR, former Labour Prime Minister and now head of his Global Institute, talks to Dorian, Naomi and Ian about escape routes from the current Parliamentary chaos, how his own policies relate to the roots of Brexit, what a good Prime Minister would do under the catastrophic circumstances Theresa May has built for herself&#x2026; and how this weekend&#x2019;s march can sway the Government when the march against his own Iraq policy didn&#x2019;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s a fascinating conversation but a word of warning: it&#x2019;s a bit of a boomy room. Watch your bass-bins, we&#x2019;re tellin&#x2019; you.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;I regret not doing more in the Referendum. I kept out of it. But afterwards I thought this is such a terrible mistake that I&#x2019;ve got to do everything I can to help stop it.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;SNP MEP for Scotland &lt;strong&gt;Alyn Smith&lt;/strong&gt; joins us for a spirited discussion of Scotland&#x2019;s experience of Brexit, what it means for the future of the UK, and the complex relationship between Remainers and Scottish nationalists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the SNP really not lending its strength to calls for a &lt;strong&gt;#FinalSay&lt;/strong&gt; referendum just because of the prospect of an IndyRef2? Should English Remainers support the SNP and if so why? And Alyn tells us about his electrifying speech after the Referendum when he urged the European Parliament &lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;I beg you,&amp;nbsp;do not let Scotland down.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS we welcome brand-new regular &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ingridoliver100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INGRID OLIVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;comedian, actor, Brexit commentator and recovering Zygon from Doctor Who &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;to the show. Does Sadiq Khan&#x2019;s intervention on a #FinalSay referendum move the needle? Why did the Migration Advisory Committee discover that immigration&#x2019;s effect on the economy is at worst net neutral and then conclude that we need a draconian and &#x201C;elitist&#x201D; immigration policy anyway? And why can&#x2019;t Brexiters who grew up and were educated in ACTUAL CASTLES keep banging on about 1066 and WWII? (Answer possibly contained within question).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;If people think that their lovely Brexit was stolen from them by a motley collection of filthy Remoaners, Jocks and Paddies, that feeling will go somewhere &#x2013; and it won&#x2019;t be good.&#x201D; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;Alyn Smith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Ingrid Oliver and Ian Dunt.

How did we get here? What could happen next? Has May engineered a Hobson&#x2019;s Choice between her Bad Deal and No Deal? And what happens if nothing happens?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS May blames Parliament for her own failings. Why John Bercow&#x2019;s Eskine Mayhem isn&#x2019;t a constitutional crisis at all. David discusses the Meaningful Vote in terms of Thanos&#x2019;s Infinity Stones. The fooling of Arron Banks. Chained to a radiator with Seumas Milne. And whatever happened to old-fashioned, sane &#x201C;euroscepticism&#x201D;? &lt;strong&gt;This week&#x2019;s episode was recorded before Donald Tusk&#x2019;s bombshell intervention this afternoon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Was our group naive?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Last sane man on the airwaves and giant of Remain JAMES O&#x2019;BRIEN of LBC joins us for possibly THE most epic interview we&#x2019;ve yet had, in a special take-no-prisoners edition of Remainiacs. From BBC balance to Paul Dacre&#x2019;s reign of terror over Tory ministers to Farage, Minford Madness and the DUP on Viagra, James puts it ALL to rights. Trust us, you don&#x2019;t want to miss this one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: The European Research Group&#x2019;s latest punishment beating for Theresa May. Peace in Northern Ireland gets thrown on the Brexit bonfire. Can new anti-Brexit party Renew move the needle? Why a Ragged Army can beat an organised mass. And the weaponisation of complaint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s moral: &#x201C;Just because you&#x2019;ve won the argument, it doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Christmelection 2019 finally, finally, finally gets under way, could Boris Johnson&#x2019;s good-time blustering turn out to be a &lt;strong&gt;campaigning bug&lt;/strong&gt;, not a feature? Why we should all have looked harder at the opinion poll which claimed that voters were OK with &lt;strong&gt;political violence&lt;/strong&gt; as long as they got their way on Brexit. And The Guardian&#x2019;s magnificent political sketch-writer &lt;strong&gt;JOHN CRACE&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to talk about his new book &lt;a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/decline-and-fail/john-crace/9781783351930" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Decline And Fail&lt;/a&gt; &#x2013; and Brexit&#x2019;s endless race between satire and reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;One thing we&#x2019;ve learned about Brexit is, it makes fools of fools.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey, Ingrid Oliver and Ian Dunt. Audio production by Elsie Bath at Soho Radio.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Sunday bonus: the first of our two DEMOCALYPSE 2019 shows at the Leicester Square Theatre from Monday 23 Sept, &lt;/strong&gt;in case you couldn&#x2019;t make it or you want to &#x201C;experience the magic&#x201D; again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen up as Dorian, Ingrid, Ian and special guest &lt;strong&gt;James O&#x2019;Brien&lt;/strong&gt; dig into the Supreme Court, the phenomenon of &#x201C;Chaos Voters&#x201D;, and the future of Divided Britain&#x2026; and they play a few rounds of that &#x2018;Leave Or Remain&#x2019; game that&#x2019;s been doing the rounds lately too. Who will get what category and is Jim Royle from &lt;em&gt;The Royle Family&lt;/em&gt; a Lexiter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recorded this show the night before the Supreme Court judgment came down, so please make allowances for certain things which might have dated it. Hold tight for audio from our &lt;strong&gt;second Democalypse 2019 show &lt;/strong&gt;from the same night, with the great &lt;strong&gt;Mark Gatiss&lt;/strong&gt; as our special guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patreon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; backers will get that show first, like they got this one too.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to receive &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; our podcasts early via your own RSS feed, plus loads more benefits, sign up at &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special shout to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulfreedman1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Paul Freedman&lt;/a&gt; for the title pic, to Charlie Elwess for scrubbing up the sound recording, and to all at the Leicester Square Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ingrid OIiver and Ian Dunt.

After Christopher Wylie&#x2019;s testimony to the Culture Committee, is the Referendum result irrevocably tainted? Does Keir Starmer care more about keeping Labour together than keeping Britain in the Single Market? Why is Ros obsessed with whale meat? And can the Brexiters successfully abolish time and space?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Journalism is a gun.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;With tottering Theresa still reeling from the proper Tusking meted out to her Chequers proposals, Ian Dunt and Andrew Harrison meet up outside the British Library to discuss the fallout from Salzburg &#x2013; which was strategically timed, of course, to miss our recording on Wednesday. They do it deliberately, we&#x2019;re sure of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plus, there&#x2019;s a twist! The Prime Minister has announced a surprise press conference and Ian has to catch a train! Stay tuned for a post-presser phone call&#x2026; and to find out if yet another day of turmoil leaves us exactly where we were.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As ever with our emergency lo-fi podcasts, sound quality on this short recording is variable. We&amp;#39;ve cut the harsher levels so it&amp;#39;s probably OK for headphones but we advise listening on speakers if possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See you next Wednesday for a more considered take on this latest Brexit mess.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do they keep doing this to us? YET AGAIN major events occur immediately after we finished recording Remainiacs on Wednesday. So YET AGAIN we&amp;#39;ve recorded a quick-and-dirty response to events. On this minicast, panel regular NAOMI SMITH talks about Theresa May&#x2019;s unprecedented bait-and-switch over the Withdrawal Bill with producer Andrew Harrison. Will Dominic Grieve and the Tory Rebels ever trust the Prime Minister&#x2019;s word again?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time we&#x2019;re not recording in a pub or a park but in the echoey chambers of Best For Britain, so beware &#x2013; sound quality is rough and ready and volume levels are unpredictable. We&#x2019;ll be back next Friday with a properly-mixed show. In the meantime, just think of this episode as an &#x201D;unreleased demo&#x201D;&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As the Prorogue Leader&#x2019;s plans fall apart at the first hurdle, we look at the fallout of The Week It All Went Wrong. Will a silenced Parliament speak louder than an active one could? Does Johnson have any real power left? And will there be anything remaining of the Tory Party after #ClassicDom Cummings has finished &#x201C;remodelling&#x201D; it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus BRIDGET PHILLIPSON, Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, joins us to correct a few myths about the Left Behinds, shine a light on the path marked No Brexit, and give us the latest on Labour&#x2019;s ever-changing Brexit moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ingrid Oliver, Alex Andreou and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week: fish, food, agriculture, immigration, Scotland and our special guest, Labour&#x2019;s deputy leadership candidate and only Scottish MP, &lt;strong&gt;IAN MURRAY&lt;/strong&gt;. On the menu: Labour&#x2019;s existential crossroads, why the party lost Scotland, the Brexit vs Corbyn blame game, and what Labour needs to do to win back Britain&#x2019;s confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Why crossing the imaginary Brexit finish line won&#x2019;t change Britain&#x2019;s inevitable reckoning with the &lt;strong&gt;immigration issue&lt;/strong&gt;. What use is the Government&#x2019;s &lt;strong&gt;greenwashed Agriculture Bill&lt;/strong&gt; when it won&#x2019;t protect us from low-standard food imports? Do &#x201C;Britain&#x2019;s fish&#x201D; really matter? And why you CAN fly your European flag after Jan 31.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The only consolation here is that the chlorinated chickens will come home to roost on the doorstep of Number Ten.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ros Taylor with Alex Andreou, Ingrid Oliver and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s been 24 hours of scarcely believable Tory chaos as the Brexit clown car finally loses its wheels. Boris Johnson and David Davis are out &#x2014; but what does it mean? IAN DUNT and DORIAN LYNSKEY hotfoot it across a febrile London to gaze in disbelief at the smoking wreckage of the Red, White and Blue Brexit.&#xA0;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beware: sound quality is variable. Regular show back on Friday as usual.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#x2019;re thrilled to welcome the legend that is &lt;strong&gt;DEBORAH MEADEN&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013; star of Dragon&#x2019;s Den, business colossus and indefatigable Remainer &#x2013; into the Remainiacs bunker. Why is she refusing to be bullied into silence over Brexit? What does it mean when the Party of Business refuses to listen to business? How does Deborah score Theresa May on leadership? What&#x2019;s it going to say on her banner at the &lt;a href="https://www.peoples-vote.uk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;People&#x2019;s Vote March&lt;/a&gt; on Oct 20th? And will Deborah accept our surprise offer of a 49% stake in a thriving young podcast company? (Spoiler: no).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus &#x2013; why won&#x2019;t pop music engage with our society&#x2019;s biggest upheaval in half a century? We meet Dutch musician &lt;strong&gt;AMBER ARCADES&lt;/strong&gt; aka Annelotte de Graaf, whose new album &#x2018;&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/63mTOiX73drtXMRiIMTAqA?si=QtR60ALZS2ytMVjP7PWGkQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;European Heartbreak&lt;/a&gt;&#x2019; turns the European crisis and Brexit itself into a lush album of poignant and thought-provoking pop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to live in a broken society. And I think I&#x2019;m well placed to point out what Brexit means for people who can&#x2019;t weather the storm as well as me&#x201D; &#x2013; Deborah Meaden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Ros Taylor with Alex Andreou and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the Brexit podcast that doesn&#x2019;t want a bloody blue passport&#x2026; The grisly spectre of NO DEAL is back from the dead. Are these morons REALLY going to crash us out of the EU with no settlement at all? Special guest ALEX ANDREOU &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;columnist, actor, cat liberationist &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;on Lexit, the triumph of irrationalism, and how Britain is breaking every bargain it ever made with EU citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus some Brexiteers ramp up the search for scapegoats, while others tell us Britain&#x2019;s future as the Cursed Earth of Europe will be good for us.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Brexit roasting on an open fire! Rees-Mogg nipping at your toes! Yes, it&#x2019;s a miserable old Christmas for Remainers, but whatever. We need to gird our loins for a big year in 2020, so&amp;nbsp;we present inspirational messages from a few of our regulars: &lt;strong&gt;Ros Taylor, Ian Dunt, Dorian Lynskey, Ingrid Oliver, Alex Andreou &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Andrew Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. (&lt;strong&gt;Naomi Smith&lt;/strong&gt; wasn&#x2019;t feeling up to it, so she sent a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; special guest). Listen now, at 3pm on Christmas Day, or maybe Christmas morning just like Jeremy Corbyn does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also our panelists choose tunes to cheer you up over the Christmas period. You can hear them in full on our &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71fWrtzPJW60dpvx1tQJD9?si=0emnNQEATCKCwprHxifiaA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Spotify playlist&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to everyone for listening and supporting us throughout the year.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to May and Corbyn for laying on some quality material for our &lt;strong&gt;extended 100th podcast&lt;/strong&gt;. Labour finally, finally comes out for a People&#x2019;s Vote. But what needs to happen first? Can TIG claim credit? And are we in for another grudging 60% campaigning performance from Jeremy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Theresa May finally, finally admits she&#x2019;ll probably have to delay Brexit. But is she just setting a trap for Remainers? &lt;strong&gt;We&#x2019;ve put this one out quickly&lt;/strong&gt; because hey, you never know what might change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus we&#x2019;re joined by not one but TWO special guests.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Britain holds its breath for the Year of Decision, the Remainiacs panel convene to look back at the ups and downs of the year that&#x2019;s just gone &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;and what we can look forward to for 2019. Gird yourself for the new year as &lt;strong&gt;Dorian Lynskey, Naomi Smith, Alex Andreou, Ian Dunt, Ingrid Oliver, Ros Taylor&lt;/strong&gt; and producer &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; look back (and forward) in anger&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;and each choose a song to energise all Remainers for the Final Battle ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recorded this show in two special sessions in December and as you&#x2019;ll hear, events have &#x201C;evolved&#x201D; a bit. But hey, that&#x2019;s podcasting. Listen closely for at least ONE 100% accurate prediction from Andrew&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can hear our panelists&#x2019; songs in full on Spotify here. (Alex&#x2019;s exact choice wasn&#x2019;t available so in the manner of Ocado we have substituted it).&amp;nbsp;Normal podcasts resume next week. Hold tight, people. It&#x2019;s going to be rough.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Just how precarious is Tory support for the Government&#x2019;s disavowal of international law via the &lt;strong&gt;Internal Market Bill&lt;/strong&gt;? Up-and-coming young author &lt;strong&gt;Ian Dunt&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to discuss his new book &lt;a href="https://www.canburypress.com/discount/HTBAL10?redirect=/products/how-to-be-a-liberal-by-ian-dunt-hardback-isbn9781912454419" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How To Be A Liberal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the airport thriller of reason-based political thought.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Few MPs have grown in status since the Brexit mess unfolded &#x2013; but DAVID LAMMY, the member for Tottenham, is one of them. We&#x2019;re delighted to have him down in the Remainiacs Bunker to discuss the unsavoury roots of Brexit, what the Windrush scandal means&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;and whether Labour will ever get off the fence regarding our membership of the EU?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;We have to be crazy if we think the country is happy with being poorer.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ian Dunt and Peter Collins.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Guardian columnist and Left Against Brexit activist ZOE WILLIAMS joins us to talk over the surreal Operation Yellowhammer, Boris Johnson&#x2019;s Operation I Still Want To Be Prime Minister, why the ERG can&#x2019;t stop battering the corpse of Chequers&#x2026; and the Brexit battle on the New Left. What will it take to dispel the Lexit fantasy?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Theresa May cravenly caves to the Brextremists yet again, are we finally trapped on a course for the catastrophic Hard Brexit that everyone fears? Lawyer and commentator DAVID ALLEN GREEN (also known as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jackofkent" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Jack Of Kent&lt;/a&gt;) joins us to explore escape routes from Brexit, the legal landscape around a People&#x2019;s Vote, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Donald Trump&#x2019;s drive-by shouting. The ghost of David Davis&#x2019;s reputation. And when &#x201C;Tommy Robinson&#x201D; gets out of jail, will Trump money try to create a dangerous British alt.right with him as its figurehead?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Britain spirals down to a Bonkers Big Ben Brexit Day Breakdown, we avert our eyes and look to the future, specifically the policies Labour might need in (gulp)&amp;nbsp;2024. Plus, has the UK actually done the EU a favour in the long term by Brexiting? And we fill up the swear jar as we ask whether Johnson can govern on a &#x201C;F*** business&#x201D; platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also: Has Brexit really cost us $170bn, more than the cost of all our contributions to the European community since we joined it 47 years ago? Why the Australians are wise to us trying to pinch their doctors and nurses. And Alex has a killer macro policy platform for Labour in 2024. Listen to find out&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Leave voters will have to blame Johnson one day&#x2026; because otherwise they&#x2019;ll be blaming themselves.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Alex Andreou, Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our bloody but unbowed Brexit Day edition.&lt;/strong&gt; As Britain slopes out of the EU like an embarrassed pub drunk, Leaver triumphalism is strangely muted. Is the Brexiters&#x2019; victory is beginning to feel a little hollow? Maybe the REAL Brexit was the enemies we made along the way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, period of reflection latest! The Labour Party sets the &#x201C;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5dc2f7b0-41f5-11ea-a047-eae9bd51ceba" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;days since we decided Jeremy did everything right&lt;/a&gt;&#x201D; clock back to zero. Why the trade talks will inevitably turn into a culture war too. What we Remainiacs have learned during this battle. Alex rouses the spirits. And a final addition to the Brexit Time Capsule.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s a bad week. But we&#x2019;ll be back in seven days time, and onwards for as long as you want us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The country has run out of season finales. All politics has left now are the mid-season filler episodes.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If (understandably) you want to think about anything but Brexit today, may we recommend our new companion podcast &lt;strong&gt;THE BUNKER&lt;/strong&gt;?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Priti Patel&#x2019;s nonpologies. Former Green MEP and Brighton &amp;amp; Hove Mayor &lt;strong&gt;Alex Phillips&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to look at how the Corona crisis could at least provide an opportunity for a green reboot of economics. Alex and Dorian read the entire leaked &lt;strong&gt;Labour antisemitism report&lt;/strong&gt; so you don&#x2019;t have to (they wish THEY didn&#x2019;t have to). Will the &lt;strong&gt;EU Corona bailout&lt;/strong&gt; actually work for European countries &#x2013; and is Britain really going to stampede towards No Deal, now of all times?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The same people who told us Brexit was more important than the economy are now telling us there&#x2019;s NOTHING more important than the economy.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;Alex Andreou&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ian Dunt and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;After a week like that we just had to reconvene and perform triage on the Deal, the People&#x2019;s Vote, the state of May&#x2019;s governmental authority and all the other walking wounded of the Brexit Infinity War. &lt;strong&gt;Dorian Lynskey&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Ian Dunt&lt;/strong&gt; and producer &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; convene in a very nice North London restaurant &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;yeah we&#x2019;re in a metropolitan bubble, what of it? &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;to find out where the latest Hell Week leaves us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ever, our emergency podcasts are a little bit more rough and ready than usual, without the caring hands of our professional producers, so please excuse the odd pop, bang and clattering teacup.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Was Brexit a sophisticated confidence trick? Scams expert, host of the BBC&#x2019;s The Real Hustle and TalkRadio presenter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexisconran" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ALEXIS CONRAN&lt;/a&gt; joins us to talk bait-and-switch, the power of emotional alignment, and whether an ill-informed, manipulable Referendum electorate was the biggest &#x201C;mark&#x201D; in modern British political history. And what now? &#x201C;The worst thing you can do,&#x201D; he tells us, &#x201C;is shove it in someone&#x2019;s face and say, &#x2018;Ha, you fell for it.&#x2019; The truth is that anyone can fall for it at the right time.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: Parliamentary hostilities resume &#x2013; hooray! What&#x2019;s really going on with ex-minister Nick Boles&#x2019; compromise plan for a &#x201C;sensible Brexit&#x201D;? Ian insults Iceland for literally no defensible reason. We talk to &lt;strong&gt;Ayesha Hazarika&lt;/strong&gt; of the new &lt;a href="https://www.peoples-vote.uk/women_for_a_people_s_vote_launch_event" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Women For A People&#x2019;s Vote&lt;/a&gt; campaign (actual studio debate with actual female panelists to follow next week). Ian insults Robert Peston for literally no defensible reason. Why are we planning to fall back on WTO rules when Donald Trump is trying to destroy the WTO? And more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AND a special extra guest &#x2013; human rights lawyer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamWagner1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ADAM WAGNER&lt;/a&gt; joins us to explain the &lt;a href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/ukineuchallenge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;crowdfunded court case&lt;/a&gt; to declare the Referendum YES THE WHOLE REFERENDUM tainted and illegal. Is this the right way to go about averting Brexit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Authoritarians hate institutions. They stop you from having a strongman &#x2013; and that&#x2019;s why they trash them.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Alex Andreou and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This edition recorded before Kent was made an independent statelet&#x2026;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;As the Internal Market Bill takes a wrecking ball to the Good Friday Agreement, Alliance Party Deputy Leader and North Down MP &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Farry&lt;/strong&gt; explains why this will shift every aspect of politics in Northern Ireland. Plus, Can Britain face going back to square one on COVID for a further six months?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s time-sensitive again so we&#x2019;re releasing this one, recorded at 2pm on Wednesday, a little early.&amp;nbsp;In our first podcast of 2019 we&#x2019;re right back into the Brexit war of attrition with the aid of special guest &lt;strong&gt;PETER KELLNER&lt;/strong&gt;, doyen of pollsters, ex-president of YouGov and expert on exactly the sort of constitutional mess we find ourselves in this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it we recorded at the exact moment the &lt;strong&gt;Grieve Amendment&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;the one that mandates the Government to come up with a Plan B if and when the May Deal is defeated &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;went to the vote. Listen as the panel try to formulate a coherent response to the result on the fly&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: Was Channel 4&#x2019;s &#x2018;&lt;strong&gt;Brexit: The Uncivil War&lt;/strong&gt;&#x2019; a worthy chronicle of Leave&#x2019;s data heist during the Referendum and does Benedict Cumberbatch convince as Dominic &#x2018;Obi-Wan Brexit&#x2019; Cummings? Will the Government get away with launching its &lt;strong&gt;Pay To Stay &#x201C;settlement scheme&#x201D;&lt;/strong&gt; for UK-resident EU citizens over Christmas, when it thought nobody was watching? And could we run a ferry company or a lorry park better than the Government?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s podcast is produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Alex Andreou, Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt (who had to rush off before the photo). Audio production is by Alex Rees. &lt;strong&gt;Remainiacs is a Podmasters production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get every new episode of Remainiacs a whole day early when you back us on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Patreon crowdfunding platform&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; plus smart Remainiacs merchandise, an exclusive weekly column by our panel, and discounts on #RemainiacsLive tickets too.&amp;nbsp;#OwnTheRemoan&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.REMAINIACS.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;REMAINIACS.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your &lt;a href="https://www.ampleplay.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;free download&lt;/a&gt; of our theme tune &#x2018;Demon Is A Monster&#x2019; Cornershop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast includes sound effects by Mike Koenig at SoundBible.com, used by permission under Attribution 3.0.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;They want power, but they don&#x2019;t know why.&#x201D;&lt;/strong&gt; How this government&#x2019;s obsession with rebutting bad COVID news is masking a total absence of ideas. As No.10&#x2019;s story on our failure to join the EU joint purchase of medical equipment falls apart, Naomi gives a true crime fan&#x2019;s guide to the timeline. Fire and brimstone among the Brexiters as a few heretics float the idea of extending transition. And is exiting under No Deal in midwinter &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;prime COVID Wave 2 time! &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;really a good idea, Minister?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The government prioritised its own image over the country&#x2019;s health, and that decision has been disastrous.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;Naomi Smith&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;These are cosplay politicians. And in a real crisis, pretend politicians cost lives.&lt;/em&gt;&#x201D; &#x2013; Alex Andreou&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ros Taylor with Naomi Smith, Alex Andreou and Ben Stewart.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The battle to keep Britain in the EU is over but with Parliament neutered, Brexit needs more scrutiny than ever. This week: Does Boris Johnson&#x2019;s &#x201C;plea for unity&#x201D; amount to a pass-agg order to shut up and accept whatever Brexit be fancies? From continuity Corbynistas to closet Centrist Dads, we run the rule over the Labour leadership candidates. Uri Geller applies for a job with Classic Dom. And Ingrid talks for the first and last time about her mum becoming a Tory MP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Remainiacs is back and we&#x2019;ll keep Brexit under the microscope as long as we&#x2019;re needed. And that could be a very long time indeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a reason they call it truth and reconciliation. We haven&#x2019;t had the truth &#x2014; so how can we have the reconciliation?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith, Ingrid Oliver and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the Brexit podcast that&#x2019;s so powerful the government schedules its bad news for Thursdays to make sure we miss it&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;Special guest &lt;strong&gt;JONN ELLEDGE&lt;/strong&gt; of the New Statesman and Citymetric joins us to talk about how urbanisation relates to Brexit. Is the old &#x201C;Remain metropolises vs Leave countryside&#x201D; conundrum really nonsense? Is there a plan for infrastructure after Brexit? And more importantly, why does Jonn love propellerheaded Brexit wonk Dan Hannan so much?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: What&#x2019;s really behind Jeremy Corbyn&#x2019;s massive turnaround regarding the single market? SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY: Can the government get a proper day of debate on the Withdrawal Bill done in one day? (Spoiler: course it can&#x2019;t). And why we might be living through a 1970s TV series called THE ARMAGEDDON SCENARIO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And marvel as we try to predict what major events we&#x2019;ll miss this week because they happened after we finished recording &#x2013; and totally miss the resignation of Paul Dacre AND Theresa May utterly duffing up David Davis over the customs backstop. Thanks Paul! Thanks Theresa and David!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Trying to understand Labour&#x2019;s Brexit policy is like learning Klingon. All that intellectual effort and then at the end of it, nobody can understand you.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented and produced by Andrew Harrison with Naomi Smith, and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the podcast that NEVER fiddles the figures: What will Brexit do to work in Britain? Employment consultant Rachel Marangozov joins us to explain what leaving the EU might really mean for the future of jobs. That odd-looking death threat to a Leave voter that Zac Goldsmith chose to share on Twitter rather than sending to the police. And more Rees-Mogg than anyone can reasonably handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Peter Collins.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s a deep-thinking edition of Remainiacs as we welcome Prof AC GRAYLING &#x2013; Philosopher, Master of the New College of the Humanities and intellectual engine-room of Remain &#x2013; to examine what Brexit really means for British democracy. Can it be stopped? How? What has it done to Britain? And the Referendum dilemma: if the 2016 vote wasn&#x2019;t truly democratic, can another referendum to fix it be democratic either?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: Jeremy Corbyn&#x2019;s baby steps towards the Brexit policy his voters wants. The leaked impact assessment that shows how any flavour of Brexit will tank the economy. Theresa May&#x2019;s poison chalice. And a surprise mystery guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also it&#x2019;s the last episode of Remainiacs for our producer Matt Hall, who is heading off to the world of Big Podcast. We&#x2019;ll miss him and we know certain listeners will miss his &#x201C;distinctive&#x201D; laugh. Farewell, Matt&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Peter Collins with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt. Producers are Andrew Harrison and (for one last time) Matt Hall.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the podcast that David Campbell Bannerman MEP wants to see prosecuted for &#x201C;extreme EU loyalty&#x201D;&#x2026; Does Britain have what it takes to live on a diet of nettle soup? Will people who never actually experienced WWII ever shut up about the &#x201C;Blitz Spirit&#x201D;? And how research shows that Leavers really are more aggressive online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS our special guest &lt;strong&gt;JASON ARTHUR&lt;/strong&gt; of the youth anti-Brexit campaign FFS (For our Future&#x2019;s Sake) comes in to explain what&#x2019;s going on with The Young People, how to get lightly disguised Leaver Jeremy Corbyn to come out against Brexit&#x2026; and how the Brexit nightmare will shape an entire generation&#x2019;s political ideals for decades into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Can you imagine if we&#x2019;d had wi-fi in the 1940s&#x2026; and then the Luftwaffe knocked out the wi-fi?&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HEATWAVE NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; We had to record this one with the windows open (it&#x2019;s health and safety gone mad) so listen closely for passing aeroplanes, beeping taxis and people clattering up and down the stairs.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The most fearsome spin doctor in politics is now a doughty fighter for Remain. ALASTAIR CAMPBELL enters the Remainiacs basement bunker to tell us what Remainers should really be doing&#x2026; why Prime Minister David Cameron (remember him? posh chap?) kept avoiding the weirdly asocial Theresa May&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;and why we&#x2019;re in a nightmare era of very serious issues decided by very un-serious people. But do the roots of the post-truth era lie in the same victory-at-all-costs news management that Alastair Campbell pioneered?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus! If May&#x2019;s transition deal is annoying the Brexit ultras, it can&#x2019;t be all bad, right? Will the Cambridge Analytica scandal shift the Brexit needle? And a brand new comic that&#x2019;s all about Brexit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;We made a choice whether to pay for stuff with money or with our data. We opted to pay for it with our data &#x2013; and BOY are we paying now.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&#x2019;s Remainiacs, Times columnist and social media fighter-of-good-fights HUGO RIFKIND joins Dorian Lynskey and Ian Dunt for this week&#x2019;s battle with the horrible Hydra that is Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week: Why Leavers shouldn&#x2019;t dare conscript the Irish abortion referendum into their arguments. Why Remain couldn&#x2019;t win another referendum the same way Leave won the last one. Do Labour MPs really have anything to fear from their Leave voters? How would YOU mark what they&#x2019;re insisting on calling &#x201C;Brexit Day&#x201D;? And Italy &#x2013; clowns to the left of me, fascists to the right&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Populism isn&#x2019;t good at answers. It&#x2019;s good at anger. But there comes a point where you can say to them, OK, you&#x2019;re in charge now. What are YOU going to do?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey and Ian Dunt. Audio production: Jack Claramunt. Producer: Andrew Harrison.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;GET IN THE FRIDGE!&#x201D; As the polls tighten on the eve of the vote, we tell you exactly where to vote tactically, how to persuade waverers, and why a Johnson majority might prove to be a curse... on Boris Johnson.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Will the PMs&#x2019; foul attitude to a sick kid in a Leeds A&amp;amp;E finally, finally move the needle among his supporters? Ian&#x2019;s tips on how to stay awake for the full horror of Election Night. Where will the anger go if Brexit ever DOES &#x201C;get done&#x201D;? Boris Johnson reveals himself to be a thin-skinned autocrat. And why we need to gear up for the mightiest pro-immigration campaign that Britain has ever seen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#x2019;ve come this far.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;After those pesky, meddlin&#x2019; peers in the House of Lords took a wrecking ball to Theresa May&#x2019;s Brexit policy, we sort through the rubble with our special guest, Greens co-leader and Brighton Pavilion MP &lt;strong&gt;CAROLINE LUCAS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are the Greens picking up votes because unlike everyone but the Lib Dems, they&#x2019;re proudly and unabashedly anti-Brexit? How do they square some of their Lexity supporters with their internationalist instincts? And why is the freebooting neoliberal Single Market ironically quite good for green politics after all?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Are we really going to join the EEA? Does the Lords rebellion mean that Jeremy Corbyn has run out of procrastinating time too? Why is Gavin Williamson a &lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;ham-faced cretin&#x201D;&lt;/strong&gt;? What does the resignation of friend of the show Heidi Alexander from Parliament mean for Remain? And all the white-hot tariff talk you can handle&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Brexit is like being sold a lovely mansion in the countryside and then finding you&#x2019;ve bought a hovel with no plumbing.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;How hard will a &lt;strong&gt;No Deal/COVID double whammy&lt;/strong&gt; hit the British economy? New research from Best For Britain shows it will devastate the places you don&#x2019;t expect as well as Brexitland. Could Black Lives Matter and America&#x2019;s revolt against institutional racism cross over to the UK? And special guest &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Trilling&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; explains how the &lt;strong&gt;new immigration regulations&lt;/strong&gt; aren&#x2019;t designed to &#x201C;take back control&#x201D; but to rip off workers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve proven you can&#x2019;t bury No Deal under Corona&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;Some 7 million jobs are doubly impacted by both.&#x201D; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naomi Smith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;In typical style, Mogg took an innovation that was working pretty well and decided they&#x2019;d replace it with something old&#x2026; just because they could.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ian Dunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;This government tries to sweep away criticism with cheery British optimism and it&#x2019;s toxic.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel Trilling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;What is it that Boris Johnson wants?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Dom&#x2019;s last stand (again): how did the supergenius who instinctively understands Britain&#x2019;s heartbeat become the most hated man in the UK? SDLP MP &lt;strong&gt;Claire Hanna&lt;/strong&gt; makes a welcome return to Remainiacs to explain the state of play in Northern Ireland vis-a-vis both COVID-19 and the cliffhanger Brexit trade negotiations. And &lt;strong&gt;Tobias Jones&lt;/strong&gt; calls in from Parma, Italy to tell us how it felt to live through one of Europe&#x2019;s grimmest COVID experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Cummings has upset one of the biggest and most dangerous constituencies in Britain: grandparents.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helen Lewis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;You can get out of a mess.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;If Remainer Conservatives and Lib Dems can&#x2019;t swallow their notion of Jeremy Corbyn, Interim Prime Minister, who CAN they agree on? Exactly how would we get to our Government of National Unity anyway? How long would it last? Why there is no Season Finale Reset Button for Article 50. What would the Remain Dominic Cummings do? And the dawn of the Meat Loaf Remainers: &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll do anything to avoid No Deal&#x2026; but they won&#x2019;t do that.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Alex Andreou and Naomi Smith.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a LOCAL podcast for LOCAL people&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;We are thrilled to have the great &lt;strong&gt;MARK GATISS&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;writer, star of &#x2018;The League Of Gentlemen&#x2018;, 'Sherlock' and 'Doctor Who', and five-star unyielding Remainer &#x2013; as this week&#x2019;s special guest on Remainiacs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen in as Mark explains how the League unwittingly predicted the Brexit mindset, why despite the Nissan news Leave has such a grip on the North-East where he was born, &lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;the weaponisation of nostalgia&#x201D;&lt;/strong&gt;&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;and which residents of Royston Vasey would have voted Remain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus! Why &#x201C;alternative arrangements&#x201D; means yet more blind man&#x2019;s Brexit. Why Labour really fears the Backstop. More on the shameless liar &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Kawcynzski MP&lt;/strong&gt;. Which Labour MP is a Pound Shop Soprano. And why you should be more relaxed about our supposed EU exit date in March but much more worried about July.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;This really is the closest we&#x2019;ve got to a civil war. We already have our Cavaliers and Roundheads. All we need is for Theresa May to go to Nottingham and raise the standard.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s podcast is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Election Week One: everyone sabotages themselves! Farage vs Rees-Mogg! Trump vs Johnson! Plus &lt;strong&gt;tactical voting:&lt;/strong&gt; our panelist Naomi Smith on the controversy over her organisation Best For Britain&#x2019;s advice site. Is B4B&#x2019;s data really a better guide than the 2017 results&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;and why is everyone so angry about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also: What sort of coalition to prepare yourself for. The most effective Parliamentary petition you &lt;em&gt;didn&#x2019;t&lt;/em&gt; know about. How Nick Clegg is still damaging independent political lobbying from beyond the grave. And what would Nigel Farage&#x2019;s d&#xE6;mon look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Britain just isn&#x2019;t big enough to fight in a shark full of tanks.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith, Alex Andreou and Ben Stewart of Led By Donkeys.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;On the agenda: The headlong rush to an end nobody voted for, and why No Deal is a man-made asteroid strike. When is the right time for a No Confidence motion against the Government? Linguistic programming as Johnson drills the buzzphrase &#x201C;undemocratic backstop&#x201D; into the national mind. Scenario planning and horizon scanning. Ingrid &#x2013; our secret agent within the Tory Party &#x2013; finally succumbs to Stockholm Syndrome. The Government&#x2019;s snappy 1,400 page No Deal for small businesses. And why food shortages, when they happen, will be all YOUR fault.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Every day in Parliament now matters. It could be that every sitting hour matters.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ingrid Oliver and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As the Coronavirus bites, the government decides it&#x2019;s a good time to cut us off from the EU Pandemic Warning system. PLUS: who makes the Nazis? &lt;strong&gt;HOPE Not Hate&#x2019;s Nick Lowles&lt;/strong&gt; on how Brexit rolled out the carpet for the extreme right, up to and including actual Nazi Satanists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red tape bad, blue tape good: the 50,000 customs officers nobody asked for. And how mad do you have to be to think that No.10 loves the Priti Patel scandal because it keeps the Russia report quiet?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201D;The reason the traditional far right is so weak is that you&#x2019;ve got people in the very centre of politics saying exactly the things they used to say.&#x201D; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;Nick Lowles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;After the EU parliamentary elections turned into a straight-up showdown between the Remain bloc and the Brexit Party, who&#x2019;s in charge now &#x2013; and what&#x2019;s left of the Tories and Labour? How can Remainers challenge the Brexiters&#x2019; simplistic narrative that &#x201C;it&#x2019;s Nige wot won it&#x201D;?&amp;nbsp;What were the REAL trends across Europe? And what&#x2019;s the message for a People&#x2019;s Vote if and when it comes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus! &lt;strong&gt;Ingrid Oliver&lt;/strong&gt; returns after too, too long. We talk to Dorian about his new book &lt;em&gt;The Ministry Of Truth: A Biography Of 1984&lt;/em&gt; and find out why it&#x2019;s the feelgood escapist beach read for 2019. And a smattering of your questions in an EU elections &lt;strong&gt;#AskRemainiacs&lt;/strong&gt; special.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;&#x2018;The bogeyman is coming to get you&#x2019; is always much more compelling as a dramatic narrative&#x2026;&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynksey with Naomi Smith, Ingrid Oliver and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;PEER PRESSURE: Newly-unbound superhero of remain Lord Andrew Adonis joins us in the Remainiacs Bunker to discuss how Brexit is infecting every aspect of government, the dirty tricks culture at No.10, and why Nigel Farage is the real Prime Minister. What&#x2019;s it like to be targeted as a &#x201C;weasel&#x201D; for speaking as your conscience dictates? And is he the right man to lead the Remain bloc?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: the return of our own IAN DUNT, the trolling in the public interest of Chris Grayling&#x2026; and welcome to the rebellion, Justine Greening MP? And a special WONK BONUS: Political writer PAUL EVANS give us his unusual recipe to fix the mess that Britain is in. Save democracy, abolish voting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Nigel Farage can have my peerage if I can have his German passport&#x201D; &#x2013; Andrew Adonis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help us to #OwnTheRemoan!

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Legendary former &lt;em&gt;Newsnight&lt;/em&gt; presenter and BBC Washington Correspondent turned doughty Remain footsoldier &lt;strong&gt;GAVIN ESLER&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to sort through the Breckage of another week in the sunlit uplands. Hold tight for&#x2026; the 50p Brexit coin! Daniel Hannan&#x2019;s plans to replace the NHS with an American-style system that has worse outcomes than the one in Cuba! Why did the Head of the Electoral Commission resign? And is the defining factor in modern politics not the alt.right or the far left but the Exhausted Middle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS our good friends &lt;strong&gt;Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris&lt;/strong&gt; tell us how they wrote the latest in the hit grown-up Ladybird books: &lt;strong&gt;The Story of Brexit&lt;/strong&gt;. And we&#x2019;ve got ten copies to give away in an actual, Swap Shop-style competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;In Brussels they say &#x2018;We used to admire Britain. Now we pity you.&#x2019; And I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s a good idea to have a Prime Minister who&#x2019;s pitied.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Ian Dunt and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We didn&#x2019;t QUITE make Wednesday night as promised at the top of the show&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;but here&#x2019;s this week&#x2019;s podcast, just in time for that EU vote. In this episode: What&#x2019;s in the WAB and has any May idea ever died quite so quickly? Final learnings from the EU Election campaign that everyone pretended never was. The pros and cons of milkshaking. Astroturfing for fun and profit. And should Labour have been on our EU Parliament hustings at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS Britain&#x2019;s glittering future in world trade! Negotiator and trade expert &lt;strong&gt;Dmitry Grozoubinski&lt;/strong&gt; explains the reality of No Deal in terms you can take away and tell your Brexity Uncle Ken (maybe). The mythical Article 24 of GATT is back, somehow, so Dmitry patiently sets out why it&#x2019;s a load of unicorn poo. And much, much more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;The fact that the Referendum happened is now used to justify the Referendum. Trade, the economy&#x2026; none of these things matter any more.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ros Taylor with Nina Schick and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, we got a kicking. Remain parties might have edged the popular vote but it didn&#x2019;t stop Boris Johnson winning the majority he always craved. So what now? Is Remain dead? Where do we put our energies from now on? Are lies and contempt for basic scrutiny the new normal for political campaigns? Will Labour face its culpability for the hard right&#x2019;s greatest success since Thatcherism? And exactly how much sleep did our panel get?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incredible though it seems, we&#x2019;ve done the easy stuff. Now it&#x2019;s a hard road ahead.&amp;nbsp;&#x201C;We are the opposition now.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Ian Dunt, Naomi Smith and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This episode recorded just before Sajid Javid got Cummingsed&#x2026;)&lt;/em&gt; The long campaign for our EU friends and neighbours is on. As Johnson&#x2019;s government breaks its promises to UK-resident EU citizens daily, &lt;strong&gt;MONIQUE HAWKINS&lt;/strong&gt; of campaigning group &lt;a href="https://www.the3million.org.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the3million&lt;/a&gt; updates us with horrific stories of government indifference and incompetence.&amp;nbsp;Plus: If Remainers are now the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/821fcb86-47a6-11ea-aee2-9ddbdc86190d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&#x201C;fruitcakes and loonies&#x201D;&lt;/a&gt; as Farage says, is there freedom in having nothing left to lose? Returning regular &lt;strong&gt;Ben Stewart&lt;/strong&gt; of Led By Donkeys on the Star of the White Cliffs of Dover and where we go next. Can Continuity Corbynism nobble Alpha Centrist Dad Keir Starmer? And more fire for your pro-European belly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;We may have a 40 year fight on our hands. But at least we live in an era when we know things can change VERY quickly.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt; &#x2013; Naomi Smith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ben Stewart.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the Brexit podcast that DOES answer questions when it brings you a cup of tea&#x2026; we&#x2019;ve got &lt;strong&gt;Garvan Walshe&lt;/strong&gt;, former Conservative Party National and International Security Policy Adviser and now columnist at ConservativeHome.com, joining us to explain how it feels to be a Tory Remainer, how electoral arithmetic means we&#x2019;re in for political paralysis forever, and what future the party has after the dust of Brexit settles in about thirty years&#x2019; time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Best For Britain&#x2019;s poll analysis shows a majority of constituencies now favour Remaining. What does that mean for a People&#x2019;s Vote and for Labour&#x2019;s endless prevarication on Brexit? And it&#x2019;s a dream come true for young Ian Dunt as he gets to present his &lt;strong&gt;Five Things You Didn&#x2019;t Know About The WTO&lt;/strong&gt;. Notebooks out &#x2013; he&#x2019;s got argument-enders galore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt. Audio production: Jack Claramunt. &lt;strong&gt;Remainiacs is a Podmasters production&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help us to #OwnTheRemoan and get smart Remainiacs merchandise plus discounts on #RemainiacsLive tickets too. &lt;a href="http://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Support us&lt;/a&gt; via the crowdfunding platform Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.REMAINIACS.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;REMAINIACS.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme music &#x2018;Demon Is A Monster&#x2019; used by kind permission of Cornershop. &lt;a href="http://po.st/RMcrnsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Buy it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As the Brexit Party Ltd&#x2019;s antics in Strasbourg grow more obnoxious, does the future belong to &#x201C;trolliticians&#x201D; who don&#x2019;t really want to achieve anything &#x2013; they just want to ruin everything around them? Should Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s pronouncement that &#x201C;liberalism is dead&#x201D; worry us? And character comedian &lt;strong&gt;KIERAN HODGSON&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to explain how his show &#x2018;75&#x2019; &#x2013; about the first EU referendum, and returning to London and Edinburgh soon &#x2013; tells us much about the 2016 one. And the next one too&#x2026;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: Another exciting creative writing challenge! Live impersonations of Roy Jenkins, Enoch Powell and Young Tony Benn. Ros has the &#x2018;Boring But Important Thing Of The Week&#x2019;. Alex demolishes the &#x201C;they need us more than we need them&#x201D; argument in less than 60 seconds. And much much more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;You&#x2019;ve monetised our misery, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Alex Andreou.

Is the Tory brand undergoing detoxification or re-retox? Plus, in bed with the DUP&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;&#x201C;shut up Guy Verhofstadt, you&#x2019;re not helping&#x201D;&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;and our favourite meddling EU regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s all in the podcast that OWNS THE REMOAN, co-presented by Dorian Lynskey, Ian Dunt of politics.co.uk and Peter Collins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen now or download for later at: http://po.st/RMNCS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REMAINIACS is a PodMasters production.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the favourite podcast of disloyal academics everywhere&#x2026; Our special guest political commentator NINA SCHICK of BBC, Sky and Bloomberg TV drops in to Germansplain the Brexit mess to we na&#xEF;ve Anglos. Turns out the German car industry isn&#x2019;t terrified of losing us at all. And those Brussels negotiations? &#x201C;Hardball from the EU? You ain&#x2019;t seen nothing yet.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus we spot the scarily prescient ideas in George Orwell&#x2019;s &#x2018;Notes On Nationalism&#x2019; from 1945 in the first Remainiacs Book Club. Also: intimidating our Remain universities. The spectre of &#x201C;Czechxit&#x201D;. And we find out how JFK accidentally saved the City of London&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;for the same reasons that we&#x2019;re about to destroy it. Well done us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;How does Europe negotiate with a partner that doesn&#x2019;t know what it wants?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to help us #OwnTheRemoan?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Early release special &#x2013; recorded at 2-3pm on Wednesday and it was up to date when we pressed &#x2018;send&#x2019;! &lt;strong&gt;THE DEAL&lt;/strong&gt; is finally here, but what does it mean? What&#x2019;s in it, who&#x2019;s going to hate it and can May get it past Parliament, the DUP, the ERG and an increasingly restive populace? Comedian, actor and fellow Brexit sufferer &lt;strong&gt;CHRIS ADDISON&lt;/strong&gt; joins us at the hinge of history to ask where we go from here, the true meaning of vassalage, how we can change the agenda&#x2026; and how Ollie from &#x2018;The Thick Of It&#x2019; would have fitted into our new political reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: We go to Tuesday&#x2019;s &lt;strong&gt;#PeoplesVote&lt;/strong&gt; rally and grab Justine Greening for a quote! What the so-called Taxpayer&#x2019;s Alliance&#x2019;s capitulation to whistleblower Shahmir Sanni&#x2019;s wrongful dismissal suit really means. What would Oliver Postgate&#x2019;s animated series &#x2018;55 Tufton Street&#x2019; be like? And is it a good idea for Remainers to buy up all the toilet paper in Britain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;There are really good technocrats working on this who have to report to a person above them who is, frankly, a numpty.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Alex Andreou and Naomi Smith.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;You thought Brexit couldn&#x2019;t get any worse? Guess again. As we hurtle towards the brick wall of No Deal, the Tories think there&#x2019;s no better moment for a time-wasting leadership contest. Luckily we&#x2019;ve persuaded two of our most popular guests of the year &#x2014; LBC legend JAMES O&#x2019;BRIEN and comedy giant DAVID SCHNEIDER &#x2014; to discuss the events of the most disgraceful week in British politics since&#x2026;. well, next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this episode: the ERG decide that the country has to be destroyed in order to save it. Theresa May&#x2019;s stockpile of horcruxes. Why &lt;strong&gt;The Death of Stalin&lt;/strong&gt; is mellow and comprehensible compared to this. How the Prime Minister will become &#x201C;A lame duck encased in steel.&#x201D; And WTF is &#x201C;managed No Deal&#x201D; anyway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus David and James choose their high points and low points of 2018 &#x2014; and conjure up some bright points of hope for 2019. It&#x2019;s an epic guestclash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REMAINIACS: Tough on Brexit, tough on the causes of Brexit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We wouldn&#x2019;t normally do this kind of thing&#x2026; but the events of Monday 10 Dec were so insane that we just had to release the audio of our latest live show to everyone, not just our beloved&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; backers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#x2019;s Part One of last night&#x2019;s show at the Leicester Square Theatre. Listen in as regulars Dorian Lynskey, Ingrid Oliver, Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt try to make sense of Theresa May&#x2019;s worsening crisis&#x2026; and wonder what might happen next. Part Two to follow later today. And do you like our yellow and blue Brexmas tree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This special podcast is &lt;strong&gt;live and unedited&lt;/strong&gt;, straight from the mixing desk.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Johnson scrapes his Oven-Ready Deal into the bin, we ask why would any other country ever trust Britain&#x2019;s word ever again? We explore the new Internal Market Bill&#x2019;s staggering contempt for international law. And the authors of &lt;a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/9781847926456?awc=3787_1599658247_95a07b58cc9bb63ccb9a0a35433540d7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Left Out: The Inside Story of Labour Under Corbyn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &#x2013; &lt;strong&gt;Gabriel Pogrund &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Patrick Maguire&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013; join us to explain what really went on during Jeremy&#x2019;s Wild Years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The government is a 24-hour rolling embarrassment and I&#x2019;m not sure what&#x2019;s supposed to be distracting from what.&#x201D; &#x2013;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Dorian Lynskey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;You have to wonder why the UK has chosen this hill to die on.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Labour&#x2019;s NEC enrages members by pushing a Confirmatory Referendum into Never-Neverland and recommitting to &#x201C;Soft&#x201D; Brexit, we invite Guardian writer and Corbyn supporter &lt;strong&gt;RACHEL SHABI&lt;/strong&gt; into the Remainiacs bunker for a candid discussion of Labour&#x2019;s Brexit contortions. Why would voters back the party in the EU parliamentary election if that vote will only be transformed into a &#x201C;vote for Brexit&#x201D;? Is it time for Remainers to give up on Labour and vote for unequivocally Remain parties? And is there still time to get Labour to change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS hear Alex read out the winner of our &lt;strong&gt;Donald Tusk Romantic Fiction Prize&lt;/strong&gt; in a truly unprecedented moment in recorded audio. Better have that cold shower running&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;If we take our foot off the pedal with Labour now, they have free rein to do whatever they want. So we can&#x2019;t take that pressure off.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Alex Andreou and Naomi Smith. Produced by Andrew Harrison.

And stop talking the Titanic down, Britain&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Either May&#x2019;s a goner now or she&#x2019;s a goner in the future when she has to pick a side.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;WE LOVE PARRIS IN THE SPRINGTIME&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;This week, noted Times and Spectator columnist and former Conservative MP MATTHEW PARRIS joins us for your weekly dose of Brexit badinage. Why do so many Tory MPs hate Boris Johnson? Is his &#x2018;Bridge Over Bullshit Waters&#x2019; feasible? What&#x2019;s life like when you&#x2019;re a Remainiac Conservative? And why should we be glad and not angry that British democracy has become a provincial car boot sale?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS More bawdy fun in long-running Westminster farce &#x2018;Carry On Ukip&#x2019;. We read Geert Mak&#x2019;s Euro-travelogue &#x2018;In Europe&#x2019; and Ian and Dorian prepare to appear on a special crossover episode with Bigmouth, the pop culture podcast. Why not subscribe at https:po.st/BGMitunes so you don&#x2019;t miss it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;The lunatics were always IN the asylum.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week the co-creators of BBC2&#x2019;s investigative dimwit Philomena Cunk &#x2013; top comedy writers JASON HAZELEY and JOEL MORRIS &#x2013; descend into the Remainiacs bunker to get all that Brexit misery off their chests. What should go inside the Museum of Brexit? How will Britain manage to negotiate a wide-ranging trade deal with the 1950s? What&#x2019;s at the core of Cunkism? And what was in the original final scenes of &#x2018;Cunk On Britain&#x2019; &#x2013; the ones they daren&#x2019;t film?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus this week&#x2019;s new Centrist party, what Hungarian fascists can teach us about our own far right, and why the &#x2018;Commonwealth Family&#x2019; has rather different perspectives on Britain than the Brexiters think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;The Tory Party managed to save it self simply by destroying the whole country.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Boris Johnson experiences embarrassing Brexitus Interruptus, the Remainiacs team discuss this week&#x2019;s knife-edge Commons votes&#x2026; what the Pause means for the Cause&#x2026; and whether voters really are coalescing around the Deal when they literally don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s special guest, undisputed godfather of election psephology &lt;strong&gt;JOHN CURTICE&lt;/strong&gt;, brings more granular polling detail than you can handle. Where are battlegrounds of opinion? Has Labour&#x2019;s &#x201C;unusual&#x201D; Brexit position set the electorate&#x2019;s imagination afire? And should people learn to shut up and fall back in love with pollsters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, exciting transfer news as we sign &lt;strong&gt;Ben Stewart&lt;/strong&gt; of Led By Donkeys as a regular panelist, bringing strength in depth to our midfield engine room for the crucial European qualifiers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prresented by Dorian Lynksey, Naomi Smith and Ben Stewart.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Theresa May bows to the inevitable and asks for a short delay to Brexit,&amp;nbsp;we ask what it&#x2019;ll mean when a merciful EU insists on rather a longer one. Do&amp;nbsp;the hard Brexit headbangers have what it takes to bring her down or are the&amp;nbsp;ERG now fatally split? Were the Lab-Con talks just about optics? What is&amp;nbsp;&#x201C;perfidious Albion&#x201D; anyway? And when a Hansard survey says a great many&amp;nbsp;Britons would be happy with a &#x201C;strongman who breaks the rules&#x201D;, do we really&amp;nbsp;have to worry about Britain falling into the hands of our own Orb&#xE1;n, Bolsanaro&amp;nbsp;or Trump?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our special guest this week is barrister and writer JAMIE SUSSKIND, author&amp;nbsp;of the fascinating exploration of the digitally-dominated society we&#x2019;ll all be&amp;nbsp;living in. Listen and find out why, in the age of Big Data and AI, Brexit is the&amp;nbsp;last thing you need to worry about. Hey, you didn&#x2019;t come to this show to be&amp;nbsp;cheered up now, did you?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Ros Taylor with Nina Schick and Ian Dunt.

Whether you came on the night and want to relive it or you couldn&#x2019;t make it, it's 90 minutes of quality RemainiAction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the menu: What did we think would happen in the Supreme Court the following day (and how wrong were we)? Who are our Brexit Heroes and why? What has Brexit done to the nature of British identity? And &#x2013; most importantly &#x2013; who will get what in the next rounds of Leave Or Remain? It&#x2019;s all worth listening to and still 90% relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it&#x2019;s a live show the sound quality and levels are necessarily a bit rough and ready, so please bear with us. Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Charlie Elwess&lt;/strong&gt; for remastering it, &lt;strong&gt;@AliQuack&lt;/strong&gt; for the photo and all at the &lt;strong&gt;Leicester Square Theatre&lt;/strong&gt; for their help.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;After our emergency podcast on Monday it&#x2019;s time for a more considered take on the Government&#x2019;s disastrous week... and the verdict is still &#x201C;WHAAAAAT?&#x201D; Does Theresa May still have a Chequers policy or just a chequered future? After BOREXIT, will Johnson become a backbench thorn in May&#x2019;s side, emerge as the next Prime Minister or just go back to being Britain&#x2019;s least lovable music hall turn? Will anyone ever mention David Davis again? All this and more we will examine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ian Dunt and Alex Andreou. Audio production by Jack Claramunt. Remainiacs is a Podmasters production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help us to #OwnTheRemoan!

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A first for Remainiacs as we welcome a guest from the Telegraph! But don&#x2019;t worry, it&#x2019;s their eminently sensible Europe Editor PETER FOSTER with a tour d&#x2019;horizon of the frosty future&amp;nbsp;that Britain faces if Johnson gets the Brexit he says he wants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus! Why can&#x2019;t we read this Russia report, then? As Nigel Farage pulls a wheeze too far, the Jacobin Rebellion finally comes home in the Brexit Party. Why Tom Watson&#x2019;s face is like an HBO box set. Is there really more Remain stuff in the Telegraph than there is Leave stuff in the Guardian? And word of the week: epistocracy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;The idea that Boris Johnson is running round the country saying Get Brexit Done? Brexit is just beginning.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Naomi Smith with Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt. Audio production by Alex Rees.

How on earth can the Government brief against the most significant constitutional judgment in &#x2013; possibly &#x2013; centuries? Where do we go from here? Should we all go out and get drunk?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the anti-Brexit podcast for people who actually KNOW how to rebel&#x2026; the Greens&#x2019; Brexit and Finance spokesperson MOLLY SCOTT CATO MEP joins us to dig into the scandal of the Leavers short-selling sterling. Did hedge funds illegally use private polling to profit from weakening the pound on Referendum Day? And where does Nigel Farage fit in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: Because you demanded it, we welcome political commentator, actor and our favourite Greek guy ALEX ANDREOU as a regular Remainiacs team member. He joins Ros Taylor and Andrew Harrison to discuss the Tories&#x2019; new anti-business business policy, what &#x201C;settled status&#x201D; for EU citizens really means&#x2026; and is the EU really going to outlaw memes? &lt;strong&gt;_DRAMATIC CHIPMUNK FACE!&lt;/strong&gt; _&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Ros has to dart out early before the end of the show. That&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;s not in the pic with Molly, Alex and Andrew.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;When Nick Clegg appeared on Remainiacs last year, the ex-Deputy PM enjoyed it so much that he asked our backroom team to help him create his own podcast&#x2026; so here&amp;#39;s a special taster for Remainiacs listeners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ANGER MANAGEMENT WITH NICK CLEGG is a new fortnightly series all about anger, and you can see more &lt;a href="https://audioboom.com/channel/nickclegg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. What is anger doing to our society? Are we stuck in an Age of Rage? And what can we do to get reason back on top?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nick promised that he wouldn&amp;#39;t stay inside his comfort zone, and he&amp;#39;s been as good as his word on this first episode with guest NIGEL FARAGE. In this clip, hear Nick lock horns with Farage over why imposing Brexit on a young generation that didn&amp;#39;t vote for it is undemocratic. The ex-Ukip leader&amp;#39;s response is quite something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can hear the &lt;a href="https://audioboom.com/posts/6816459-king-of-chaos-nick-clegg-interviews-nigel-farage"&gt;full show here&lt;/a&gt;.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;On the agenda: the Conservatives&#x2019; self-inflicted purgatory. The &lt;strong&gt;squabble for the Party leadership&lt;/strong&gt;, and why Rory Stewart is the Tory Corbyn (Torbyn?). &lt;strong&gt;Trump Week&lt;/strong&gt; and Britain&#x2019;s future as trade partner or prey. And the sad end (or is it?) of &lt;strong&gt;Change UK. &lt;/strong&gt;It&#x2019;s all here in an absolutely fascinating extra-length conversation with a titan of our political times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there&#x2019;s a ray of hope too. &lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The Brexit Party is thriving on paralysis,&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt; Dominic Grieve tells us. &lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Take away that paralysis and they will begin to fade.&#x201D; &lt;/em&gt;Let&#x2019;s hope so.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;DON&#x2019;T CALL IT A COMEBACK! As Parliament returns in righteous anger and the Brexit Press bleat about how the Supreme Court has DESTROYED DEMOCRACY, the Remainiacs team reconvene to find out if everything really &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; changed. Special guest &lt;strong&gt;ROBERT WEBB&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013; &lt;em&gt;Peep Show&lt;/em&gt; star, author and fellow appalled Brexit-watcher &#x2013; joins us to explore this next circle of hell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week: Watching history in the pouring rain. Should the Labour Party be grateful that the Supreme Court furore took the spotlight off the Brexit stitch-up at its conference? Who spiked Geoffrey Cox&#x2019;s latte with crazy juice and how did Barry Shearman handle it? Do the Nazis in the Mitchell &amp;amp; Webb &#x201C;are we the baddies?&#x201D; sketch hold the key to Britain&#x2019;s psyche? And why won&#x2019;t Boris Johnson resign?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The government&#x2019;s plan is so clearly to smear Parliament because it couldn&#x2019;t shut it down.&#x201D;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor, Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&#x2019;s not a deal if only one person wants it.&lt;/strong&gt; This week, the Government breaks its promise on no customs checks in the island of Ireland with an offer the EU can&#x2019;t excuse. Is Johnson throwing Ireland under the Boris Bus (again) and why does the government&#x2019;s creation of narrative take precedence over actually solving the border issue?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plus:&lt;/strong&gt; Priti Patel decides that Britain is not a country but a Russell Group university. &lt;strong&gt;Civil unrest&lt;/strong&gt; updates: why you can&#x2019;t use the threat of people rioting to get what THEY want just get what YOU want. What really makes &lt;strong&gt;Dominic Cummings&lt;/strong&gt; tick? And special guest &lt;strong&gt;Chris Southworth&lt;/strong&gt; of the International Chamber of Commerce gives us the latest on those amazing WTO terms that the Brexiters think will save our antibiotics-laced bacon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t have to change tariff environment very much at all to make the UK unviable.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is Brussels&#x2019; hamfisted approach to resurrecting the European economy really a danger the EU&#x2019;s own existence?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Surprise special edition incoming&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;It&#x2019;s Euro elections week and lots of us STILL don&#x2019;t know who to vote for. On Friday 17 May we brought together people from the key national parties who are hunting the Remainer vote to make their pitch in semi-hustings format. London MEP candidates DINESH DHAMIJA&amp;nbsp;(Lib Dems), LAURA PARKER (Labour) and JAN ROSTOWSKI (Change UK) plus AMELIA WOMACK (Deputy Leader of the Greens for England and Wales) joined Dorian Lynskey for an hour of free-range podcanvassing in our London studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the agenda: Who should you vote for and why? What&#x2019;s behind Labour&#x2019;s strategic indeterminacy? What would the candidates prioritise if and when they got to Brussels? If we remain, what are they going to reform? And which candidates can out-European the others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A note on the guests: It&#x2019;s a small London-based studio so we had to make the decision to invite only parties that are standing nationally, which means we couldn&#x2019;t cover the SNP or Plaid Cymru. We&#x2019;ll be addressing Scotland, Ireland and Wales in our final pre-vote show on Wednesday. But let&#x2019;s face it, none of you want to hear from the Conservatives or the Brexit Party anyway, do you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey. Produced by Andrew Harrison. Audio production by Alex Rees and Tom Bullen at Air Edel Studios, London. &lt;strong&gt;Remainiacs is a Podmasters production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we meet the most important people in the whole Brexit mess: the people who voted Leave, now regret it and are fighting hard for a #PeoplesVote. Emma Huckey and Hugh Norris of grassroots group &lt;a href="https://www.remainernow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Remainer Now&lt;/a&gt; join Alex, Naomi and Andrew for a stirring discussion of why they changed their minds &#x2013; and their tips on how to persuade wavering Leavers over to our side of the fence. &#x201C;How did I feel after the Referendum?&#x201D; says Hugh. &lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;I&#x2019;d never felt so played in my life.&#x201D;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus BREXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP: What can Remainers do to make Theresa May&#x2019;s &lt;strong&gt;Festival of Brexit Britain&lt;/strong&gt; into the swimming success it so clearly deserves to be? (You can guess where this one goes). The shameful &lt;strong&gt;immigration clampdown&lt;/strong&gt; and the upcoming &lt;strong&gt;trade climbdown&lt;/strong&gt;.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week: Are Brexit jihadis using the summer break to acclimatise voters to No Deal as if it&#x2019;s some sort of sensible idea instead of kamikaze economics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALSO: Chilli con Carney on the menu as Bank of England boss &lt;strong&gt;Mark Carney receives a punishment beating&lt;/strong&gt; for doing his job. Wild praise for Emily Maitlis and a terrible shoeing for Bernard Jenkin MP. Steve Bannon in a Monopoly top hat and monocle. The Telegraph tells the Tories they&#x2019;re &lt;strong&gt;not right-wing enough&lt;/strong&gt;. And what Brexit will mean for &lt;strong&gt;carers of aged or infirm relatives&lt;/strong&gt;. Spoiler: it&#x2019;s women who&#x2019;ll bear the brunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: we&#x2019;re delighted to welcome back the much-missed &lt;strong&gt;ROS TAYLOR&lt;/strong&gt; who brings her unique Brexit insights to the show, including how the female Leave vote was partly swayed by&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;whale meat and bullfighting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll be sitting in your own poo, with no sandwiches.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;BREXPLICIT LANGUAGE ALERT: This week special guest and Great British comic AL MURRAY wades into the Brexit mess in no uncertain terms (and he hasn&#x2019;t even got his Pub Landlord hat on).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How quickly does Nigel Farage&#x2019;s bloody-good-laugh persona dissolve when you stand against him in a General Election? Is the Pub Landlord suffering a terrible case of Bregret and confusion? And what the hell is really going on with Labour&#x2019;s invisible Brexit policy? Best not play this one on the school run unless you want the kids to learn exciting new vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also this week: major shout-outs for the first of our PATREON supporters. Will YOUR name be read out in comedy fashion by Al or one of the panel?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The March. The Revoke petition. The Government that can&#x2019;t govern and the amendment that put MPs in charge of Britain&#x2019;s destiny at last. Was this the week that Brexiters lost control of Brexit?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that quiet moment before the Indicative Votes we welcome &lt;strong&gt;JOHN HARRIS&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013; the Guardian&#x2019;s wandering Brexit Britain correspondent &#x2013; to work out where we are, what happens next, and what the unheard parts of Britain will make of the Brexit endgame. Plus: What Brexit will do to Uncle Joe&#x2019;s Mint Balls and skateboards from Bristol. The crap punk roots of the No Deal ultras. And why Labour keeps on fattening the pig for market day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;We live in the age of the right-wing anarchist.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s the most blunderful time of the year&#x2026; Gather round the fire for the REMAINIACS End Of Year special. Regulars Ian Dunt, Ros Taylor, Dorian Lynskey, Naomi Smith and Peter Collins share their heroes, high points, low points and hidden significant moments from the year that Brexit went from gung-ho confidence to the May&#x2019;s Mess. And it ain&#x2019;t over yet. Plus we&#x2019;ve got exclusive Brexmas Carols from the magnificent cast of Brexodus: The Musical. Learn the words and sign them to your Kipper auntie and uncle over Christmas dinner. It&#x2019;s sure to break the ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cast: JAMES SANDERSON as Boris Johnson, AIRLIE SCOTT as Theresa May and JAMES TAYLOR THOMAS as Michael Gove &#x2013; with lyrics and piano by DAVID SHIRREFF and piano by FREDERICK APPLEBY. http://brexitthemusical.eu/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING - This show contains adult language as well as seditious conversation.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Government&#x2019;s immigration plans are out and yes, they&#x2019;re every bit as narrow, vindictive, boneheaded, vicious and philistine as we expected. What next when the hostile environment leaves the people who voted for it without the health care and other workers they need? Plus former Lib Dem MEP &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CarolineVoaden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caroline Voaden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explains what Brussels and Strasbourg really think of us.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;We got knocked down but we&#x2019;ll get up again. Join the panel of REMAINIACS for our last live show of 2019 and our last full podcast of the decade &#x2013; recorded onstage in London&#x2019;s Leicester Square Theatre on Tuesday 17 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s election post-mortem time but there&#x2019;s no room for misery. How did the Remain parties blow it so spectacularly? Was it really all down to Corbyn&#x2019;s massive turn-off factor? Where should Remain&#x2019;s tattered but unbowed legions put their energies now? And what awaits in the 2020s?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus our panel play one final round of popular party game Leave Or Remain? And there&#x2019;s a special treat for listeners with the live debut of disco troupe ARTICLE 54, creators of &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5FnvU0cEgFU81QwIgWzjeF?si=fzeKzkf5SRi2djflesWOIg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;The Hustle: A Brexit Disco Symphony&lt;/a&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;now streaming near you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#x2019;s it for 2019 but &lt;strong&gt;we WILL be back in 2020&lt;/strong&gt;, come hell, WAB or high water. Maybe we can&#x2019;t stop Brexit any more but we can shine a light on what&#x2019;s happening in a way the opposition parties seem constitutionally incapable of. As ever, your support is what keeps us going. We wish every listener and Patreon backer a happy Christmas and a hopeful new year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ian Dunt, Ros Taylor and Alex Andreou. Post-production by Alex Rees. Many thanks to Jess and the whole Leicester Square Theatre team, and to Article 54:&amp;nbsp;Rhodri&amp;nbsp;Marsden, Susannah Henry, Sharron Fortnam, Mira Manga and Helene Bradley.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;In a special mini-episode, Alex Andreou puts his mellifluous voice to a Twitter thread he did with Best for Britain earlier this week, about the need to start saying &#x201C;No&#x201D; to the so-called strongmen who don&#x2019;t understand the meaning of the word&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The column is dedicated to Ruth, on her birthday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Alex @sturdyAlex on Twitter, and B4B @BestForBritain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get every new episode of Remainiacs a whole day early when you back us on the Patreon crowdfunding platform.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;strong&gt;Belarus&lt;/strong&gt; fights its way towards true democracy, we speak to a protestor who&#x2019;s on the ground in Minsk about what&#x2019;s really happening and what we can do to help. Plus: Can &lt;strong&gt;Kamala Harris&lt;/strong&gt; thread her way past hard right lies, sexism, racism and a left that can&#x2019;t be satisfied? Plus &#x2018;&lt;strong&gt;Leftwaffe&lt;/strong&gt;&#x2019;, &#x2018;&lt;strong&gt;Starmtroopers&lt;/strong&gt;&#x2019; and our least favourite political neologisms. Special guest &lt;strong&gt;Marie Le Conte&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to discuss these weighty matters &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;plus the horrific Politics Gossip Drought of 2020.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;We&#x2019;re governed by unexceptional people from exceptional schools.&#x201D; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dorian Lynskey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;If the word &#x2018;sleaze&#x2019; became attached to the Major government, &#x2018;incompetence&#x2019; is attaching itself to this government.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ben Stewart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Nina Schick and Ben Stewart.

It&#x2019;s OK for Ingrid! She&#x2019;s got a German passport. What about the rest of us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: Theresa May&#x2019;s Third Way on customs: unicorn or dead duck? DANNY DYER speaks for England. The NHS treacherously prepares for a Hard Brexit, just because they want to look after their patients.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As Boris Johnson continues to fumble everything he touches, &lt;strong&gt;are the Tory Right losing patience&lt;/strong&gt; with their flop-haired figurehead? Gove is preparing a &#x201C;shock and awe&#x201D; ad campaign to sell No Deal to voters. How did we get from &#x201C;sunlit uplands&#x201D; to deliberately inciting fear among the public? Plus, Britain thinks of itself as a magnet for &lt;strong&gt;foreign students&lt;/strong&gt;. But will COVID and the Corona recession, the toxic legacy of the Hostile Environment and Brexit itself combine to wreck Britain&#x2019;s university sector? We talk to higher education analyst &lt;strong&gt;Martin McQuillian&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The question is, which generation, which region, which voters will Johnson betray?&#x201D; &#x2013;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Naomi Smith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;I&#x2019;m always suspicious when government announces a big number like &#xA3;1 billion. It reminds me of Dr Evil&#x2026;&#x201D; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin McQuillian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe they&#x2019;re cancelling the wives of people who fly racist banners.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the no-bullshit Brexit podcast&#x2026; The Withdrawal Bill is in play, so is it time for the Tory Mutineers to finally grow a backbone? Evening Standard columnist ROSAMUND URWIN and stand-up comic GR&#xC1;INNE MAGUIRE join us to thrash it all out. Plus: what&#x2019;s it like to work with George Osborne?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Special guest STELLA CREASY &#x2013; Walthamstow MP, out-and-out Remainer and biggest* Wedding Present fan in the Commons &#x2013; joins us in the week that the Government decided that its own contingency advice for No Deal was too alarming for the simple British public to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(* OK, only).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging chat with Stella we ask&#x2026; How can we get &lt;strong&gt;Labour to make a stand against Brexit&lt;/strong&gt; before it&#x2019;s too late? Now that Vote Leave&#x2019;s deceitful Facebook ads have been exposed, can Britain regulate its way out of the political nightmare of &lt;strong&gt;Dark Ads and social media vitriol&lt;/strong&gt;? Is there a realistic route to a &lt;strong&gt;People&#x2019;s Vote&lt;/strong&gt;? And what&#x2019;s going on with Walthamstow&#x2019;s favourite son, &lt;strong&gt;Brian Harvey of East 17?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS we welcome brand new regular &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NinaDSchick" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;NINA SCHICK&lt;/a&gt; &#x2013; in-demand political journalist, Brexit specialist and German citizen &#x2013; to the Remainiacs panel with her penetrating perspective from Berlin and beyond.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the podcast that gets through European customs faster than Trump gets through Comms Directors&#x2026; After that shocking Brextremism poll, do Leave voters REALLY want their kids to be poorer? Ian gets trolled by David Davis&#x2019;s new Chief of Staff. Is the Duke of DExEU really positioning himself as an even worse PM than we&#x2019;ve already got? And if you thought that Leave voters would suffer most under Brexit, there&#x2019;s a plot twist. It might be Remain areas that really feel the pain.

PLUS Damon Albarn of Blur releases a Brexit concept album with his band The Good, The Bad And The Queen.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;You wait forever for a Conservative Remainer on the show&#x2026; and then two come along at once. This week &lt;strong&gt;SIMON ALLISON&lt;/strong&gt; of &#x201C;Torymainer&#x201D; group &lt;a href="https://citizens4britain.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Citizens4Britain&lt;/a&gt; joins us to discuss the Tory conference gagging Brexit dissenters, how the Party of Business became the Party of F**k Business, why Tories need to Take Back Control of their own party&#x2026; and where next for a country with a Government that can&#x2019;t govern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: What&#x2019;s behind the hazy notion of Theresa May&#x2019;s offer of an unconditional Right To Remain for EU citizens, even under No Deal? Who&#x2019;s pushing it and who&#x2019;s blocking it? Do Remainers all have to wear SuperDry now that its co-founder is backing the People&#x2019;s Vote? We brace ourselves for those technical papers. And the long-awaited return of &lt;strong&gt;#AskRemainiacs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;If the Tory Party really has lost touch with the intellectual classes then it&#x2019;s going to become the Stupid Party of the 1830s forever.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Naomi Smith with Nina Schick and Ian Dunt.

Fuelled by strong coffee and Red Bull, they discuss the problems with calling an election no one really wants, the end of Paul Nuttall impersonator Paul Nuttall, and those lovely people in the DUP.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s an exciting week as we welcome Superhero of Remain GINA MILLER to tell us about her battles over Article 50 and now the Government&#x2019;s &#x201C;deal&#x201D; with the DUP, the future of the battle against Brexit, and how she made Nigel Farage VERY uncomfortable on a TV studio sofa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, BORIS JOHNSON, BUSTED FLUSH: Did the Foreign Secretary actually read that pro-Brexit screed before he sent it to the Telegraph? (We suspect not). Has the Talking Fatberg finally followed his ambitions too far? Also: Ringo Starr, Leave supporter, and why working for DExEU is like having Enron on your CV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus we&#x2019;re delighted to debut our brand-new theme tune by the great British band CORNERSHOP. Had a brimful of Brexit? So have we&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you&#x2019;re here, why not support Remainiacs via our PATREON page? http://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Move closer Nigel, it&#x2019;s so much more comfortable here.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This episode of REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ian Dunt and Peter Collins.

Heroes of Remain and creators of our theme tune &lt;strong&gt;Cornershop&lt;/strong&gt; join us to discuss their new album &#x2018;England Is A Garden&#x2019; and making defiant, multicultural pop in a xenophobic era. The Brexiters&#x2019; ongoing Culture War turns into an actual war on culture. The Points-based Pandora&#x2019;s Box continues to spill its poison. And a glorious future of British &#x201C;champagne&#x201D; industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Brexit was both parties losing at once.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Remainiacs welcomes SNP Westminster deputy leader and economics spokesperson KIRSTY BLACKMAN MP for a long-overdue Scottish perspective on Brexit. What does our departure from the EU mean for Scottish independence? Which would she prefer: no Brexit and Scotland stays in the EU, or independence but Scotland outside the EU? Will the SNP leave the &#x201C;rUK&#x201D; in the Brexity lurch? Listen in as our cast cite great-aunties from Arbroath in a bid to nail a Scottish passport after we leave the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus! The national shame of the &lt;strong&gt;Windrush scandal&lt;/strong&gt;, and why Theresa May&#x2019;s &#x201C;hostile environment&#x201D; for immigrants is the poison inside Brexit. Can the &lt;strong&gt;House of Lords&lt;/strong&gt; frustrate Brexit, and if they can, should they? More contents for our Brexit Time Capsule. And a special appearance by long-time listener, first-time caller &lt;strong&gt;Nigel Farage&lt;/strong&gt;&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t appease the ignorant minority of xenophobes in this country. You have to oppose them.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Peter Collins. Audio production: Jack Claramunt.

If we&#x2019;re going to &#x201C;remain and reform&#x201D; what exactly is that supposed to mean? And could we pull it off anyway?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So we&#x2019;re finally here. &lt;strong&gt;Boris Johnson thinks he&#x2019;s got a deal. &lt;/strong&gt;Arlene Foster isn&#x2019;t so sure. Nobody knows what&#x2019;s &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the deal &#x2013; but some of the ERG think it&#x2019;ll pass the Commons anyway. The Remainiacs team gather to work out what we know, what we don&#x2019;t know&#x2026; and what we think will be put before Parliament on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus special guest &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Butcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of TechForUK joins us to explain the digital tools he and his cross-platform team of wonks and ninjas have built to fight Brexit, and which ones will come into play at Saturday&#x2019;s March in London.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This one&#x2019;s in danger of being superseded by events so it&#x2019;s out a day early&#x2026; We recorded it just a little too soon to catch the heroic demise of &lt;strong&gt;Rory Stewart&lt;/strong&gt;. But we did catch the latest Blue on Blue atrocities from the Tory leadership squabble, plus depressing research that shows the British people are more hostile to compromise than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, indestructible feminist warrior &lt;strong&gt;CAROLINE CRIADO-PEREZ&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to discuss the &lt;a href="https://www.bestforbritain.org/marchforchange" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;March for Change&lt;/a&gt; on Sat 20 July, and why Brexit always was a feminist issue. Plus: What Ingrid did on her holidays. The rise of the Centrist Entrists.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;PODFLASH: Two big Brexit stories broke immediately after we finished recording last week&amp;#39;s episode, and we didn&amp;#39;t want to wait til next Friday to deal with them. So Ian Dunt met our producer Andrew Harrison in the Red Lion pub off Whitehall to discuss the trashing of philanthropist George Soros &#x2013; is Britain REALLY buying the worst conspiracy theories of Eastern European autocrats? Plus, those leaked regional impact statements and what they mean. Beware: pubby background noise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regular scheduled episodes return on Friday 16 Feb as normal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Audio production: Jack Claramunt.

Plus Femi and Seb&#x2019;s highs and lows of 2018, their hopes for next year&#x2026; and the seasonal return of &lt;strong&gt;#AskRemainiacs&lt;/strong&gt;.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Norway option, gammon wars and the plight of expats with DR MICHAELA BENSON of Goldsmiths University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the week when confusion continues to reign about the EEA option, Labour&#x2019;s Brexit policy and what to do about customs, we talk to sociologist Dr Michaela Benson about how the endless uncertainty is affecting British citizens who live in the EU27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who are the BrExpats, apart from pensioners in Spain and DJs in Berlin? How nervous are they about the future? What, if anything, are governments doing to put their minds at rest? And why on earth are some of them still proud enthusiasts for Brexit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus! Will centrist pin-up David Miliband&#x2019;s transatlantic intervention move the dial? Has the penny finally dropped for Daniel Hannan? Do any remainers still think that Jeremy Corbyn is on their side? Is the Electoral Commission&#x2019;s punishment of Leave.EU more than a slap on the wrist? Is calling red-faced Brexiters &#x201C;gammon&#x201D; racist? (No) And are we surprised by the UN rapporteur on racism&#x2019;s findings that Britain has become a more hostile environment since the referendum? (Also no)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some UK citizens living overseas will probably lose their right to vote in both local and European elections - the idea of not being able to vote for anything anywhere is quite upsetting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Peter Collins. Audio production: Sophie Black. Producer: Andrew Harrison. Remainiacs is a Podmasters production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help us to #OwnTheRemoan!

Welcome to podcast where panel talk about how great nation of Russia did not interfere with British elections, no way. Is Russophobia only. &#x427;&#x435;&#x441;&#x442;&#x43D;&#x43E;! Also, do not read &lt;strong&gt;Russia Report&lt;/strong&gt;, is also Russophobic. &#x421;&#x43F;&#x430;&#x441;&#x438;&#x431;&#x43E;!&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile: Is now a good time to pick a fight with &lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt;, however badly China might be acting? Why have MPs who demanded control of our trade deals just voted away their power to, er, &lt;strong&gt;control our trade deals&lt;/strong&gt;? And there&#x2019;s a job going where you report to Dominic Cummings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The moral is, if anything in any way affects our special Brexit cult, then apparently we must not look at it.&#x201D; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x2013; Arthur Snell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;We now know these guys are weak.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Can it only be a year since Britain voted itself poorer, angrier and more irrelevant? Regulars Dorian Lynskey, Ian Dunt of politics.co.uk and Peter Collins plus some of our special guests recall where they were and what they were doing on the magical day we took back control &#x2013; and promptly lost it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relive that special day with guests Sindhu Vee and Naomi Smith plus friends of the show John Niven and Mark Hooper. And don&#x2019;t forget to #OwnTheRemoan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen now or download for later at: http://po.st/remainiacs-podcast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REMAINIACS is a PodMasters production.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;No sooner had we pressed "stop" on recording Wednesday's show than all sorts of bizarre events unfolded. Brexit cheerleader Paul Dacre announced his retirement from editing the Daily Mail, David Davis went through another pantomime resignation threat&#x2026; and Boris Johnson's attempts to get sacked reached new heights of absurdity. "Pro bono publico, no meltdown" &#x2013; really?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Ian and producer Andrew headed to London's lovely Hyde Park (pubs are too noisy) to quickly get it all down so you don't have to wait a week. Forgive our dodgy sound quality &#x2013; we thought you'd want it as quick as we could get it to you. Enjoy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Confidence is a preference for what is known as&#x2026; PARK CAST."&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Recorded before Germany pulled Brexit from next week&#x2019;s summit AND before &#x201C;mutant algorithm&#x201D;. This week, after his feeble response to the Summer of Messes, &lt;strong&gt;is governing just too hard&lt;/strong&gt; for our work-averse Scarlet Pimpernel of a Prime Minister? &lt;strong&gt;Minnie Rahman&lt;/strong&gt; of the JCWI joins us to look at who&#x2019;s weaponising the Channel refugees issue, and what the Dublin Regulation really means. Plus: the brain-destroying fake &#x2018;Land of Hope And Glory&#x2019; row and our Clickbait Government. And Johnson trolls us by toying with loutish escapee from Australian politics and all-round big galah &lt;strong&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/strong&gt; as our &#x201C;trade supremo&#x201D;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;We haven&#x2019;t heard anything from Johnson on A-Levels or anything that matters &#x2013; but as soon as there&#x2019;s a culture war story, up he pops.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ian Dunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The British people are in a constant state of shock and disbelief. They just don&#x2019;t believe that really bad things can happen to them.&#x201D; &#x2013;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Minnie Rahman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Ideology is now conflicting with real life and it&#x2019;s making the cultists look desperate.&#x201D; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naomi Smith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Boris Johnson approaches being Prime Minister like one of these YouTube influencers who want to be famous without doing any of the things that actually make you famous.&#x201D; &#x2013;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ian Dunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the &lt;strong&gt;People&#x2019;s Vote March&lt;/strong&gt; we ask: it&#x2019;s all very well winning a chance to vote again but how do we carry the day? Who do we target, how do we campaign&#x2026; and what happens if it&#x2019;s a choice of Deal Or No Deal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: What does the impending fall of &lt;strong&gt;Speaker John Bercow&lt;/strong&gt; mean for Parliament&#x2019;s role in the Brexit &#x201C;process&#x201D;? Are the Met really dragging their feet on investigating the &lt;strong&gt;Leave campaign&#x2019;s alleged cheating&lt;/strong&gt; because of political pressure? And a surprise guest appearance from Pearse Smith of &lt;strong&gt;Our Future Our Choice Northern Ireland&lt;/strong&gt;, telling us how the whole Brexit mess looks from the perspective of young people who have grown up with the Good Friday Agreement and don&#x2019;t want to lose it just because Jacob Rees-Mogg thinks Armagh is a large wardrobe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;If the UK is going to remain in a Customs Union, what was the point of this exercise?&#x201D; &#x2013; Nina Schick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Ian Dunt, Nina Schick and Naomi Smith.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the premier reason-based podcast for Brexit-watchers&#x2026; &lt;strong&gt;The BBC&#x2019;s coverage of Brexit&lt;/strong&gt; is causing increasing alarm. Is the Corporation failing in its duty to explain? Is it just frightened of government and demagogues? How do we fix it? Is John Humphrys really past his sell-by date? And if Remainers join the Bash The BBC mob, will we all live to regret it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Theresa May&#x2019;s world tour of Britain&#x2019;s cow-sheds. With even volunteers for Vote Leave saying there must be a Final Say referendum, will it happen? Special guest &lt;strong&gt;Harry Eyres&lt;/strong&gt; tell us about his new satirical book &#x2018;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Johnsons-Brexit-Dictionary-Really-Means/dp/1782274987/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1522947037&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=johnson%27s+brexit+dictionary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson&#x2019;s Brexit Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;&#x2019;. And we answer your queries in the return of &lt;strong&gt;ASK REMAINIACS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;The Prime Minister looked like a 12-year old girl being dragged to the dentists.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Andrew Harrison with Peter Collins and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is the Government&#x2019;s piecemeal lockdown driving as big a wedge between the North and South of England as there is between Westminster and the devolved governments? Plus our special guests, Manchester University politics professors &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robfordmancs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Ford&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ProfSobolewska" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Sobolewska&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, join us to talk about their new book &lt;a href="https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Maria-University-of-Manchester-Sobolewska/Brexitland--Identity-Diversity-and-the-Reshaping-of-British-Politics/25081533" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brexitland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Identity, Diversity and the Reshaping of British Politics&lt;/em&gt;. Do the roots of Brexit really go back to the 1960s? And where do we go now that we&#x2019;re all alone in Brexitland, our only home?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Once voters see politics as a big fight of us against them, it&#x2019;s really hard to get them to think about anything else.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#x2013; Rob Ford&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;In Johnson&#x2019;s conference speech, the only mention of the North was a jibe at North London.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;Ros Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;People may want lockdown, but not necessarily for themselves&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#x2013; Ros Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;If Remain had won, the leavers in the Conservative party wouldn&#x2019;t have given up as easily as Cameron assumed&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#x2013; Maria Sobolewska&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week MITCH BENN &#x2013; comedian, musician and treacherous mind-controlled slave of Brussels &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;joins us in the Brexit Bus as it screams towards the brick wall of No Deal. And he&#x2019;s quite optimistic. &#x201C;What there is to be won here,&#x201D; he tells us, &#x201C;we on the Remain side are winning.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Why Theresa May is telling the EU one thing about Brexit and the UK another. Alan Partridge vs Malcolm Tucker in The Big Issue. And it turns out Britain really did vote itself poorer. As Mitch so picturesquely puts it&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;I no more want a successful Brexit than I want to successfully slam my balls in the car door.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to help us #OwnTheRemoan?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;With the world gripped by the most significant anti-racist demonstrations in half a century, why are we still obsessing over Churchill? Do we overstate the power and significance of ageing Nazis in off-brand polo shirts running around Trafalgar Square? Could Britain actually shrink its police? Plus: so farewell then, DFiD. How the spread of fake data is producing a &#x201C;Liar&#x2019;s Dividend&#x201D;. And why Marcus Rashford can only nutmeg the Government once.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The goal of far right politics IS violence. So in a sense the conduct of its supporters is beside the point.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alex Andreou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Creating new crimes to support their authority is what autocrats do.&#x201D; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ros Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Nina Schick, Ros Taylor and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Deck the balls with Multi-level Regression and Post-stratification polling! Our penultimate live show of the year saw a full-panel turnout for a festive evening of the latest Brexit analysis, campaign horror stories, pre-election recrimination and the hellishly difficult&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Have I Got Brexit For You&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;quiz. If you were there you can relive it. If not, you can pretend you were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hold tight for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Naomi Smith, Dorian Lynskey, Ian Dunt, Ros Taylor, Nina Schick, Ingrid Oliver, Alex Andreou&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a special two-part live show of top quality discussion, poor quality jokes and audience questions at the end. We look at the election campaign and how the parties have fared, plus the state of populism and&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; as the political decade ends in farce and deception &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;a few Big Ideas that might make the 2020s more optimistic and tolerable than the 2010s. Gather the family!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Leicester Square Theatre for sound recording.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The moment of truth is finally here. Johnson-Cummings have decided it&#x2019;s necessary to destroy parliamentary sovereignty in order to &#x201C;save&#x201D; it. But the Remain Alliance finally has its act together &#x2014; and the numbers to stop No Deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Andreou is optimistic. Remain Wonder Woman Naomi Smith is ready for battle to be joined. Host Andrew Harrison is panicking. And special guest HUGO RIFKIND of The Times wonders why he picked this week to do Remainiacs&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen up.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Clear the lobby for special guest &lt;strong&gt;JOHN BERCOW&lt;/strong&gt;, the most controversial Speaker in recent history. He visits Remainiacs to talk about his time in charge of Commons at war, his new autobiography &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1474616623?pf_rd_p=f20e70b1-67f9-48d1-8c78-ba616030b420&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=03DVG89CVQQG27EHFV7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unspeakable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, what Remain got wrong, David Cameron&#x2019;s disastrous miscalculations, whether he&#x2019;d do &lt;em&gt;Strictly&lt;/em&gt;&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;and those incendiary bullying allegations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: The Government starts its relationship with the EU as it means to go on, in loutish bad faith. Why Cummings is losing a war with Sajid Javid that nobody understands. What Ros saw in Parliament Square on Brexit night. And why it isn&#x2019;t wrong to point out when stupid people do stupid things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;As far as David Cameron was concerned his principle WAS his career so the idea of giving up your career for your principles was somewhat alien to him.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;JOHN&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;BERCOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;div&gt; &lt;strong&gt;We were expecting a funeral march. Instead we got a victory procession &#x2013; of sorts.&lt;/strong&gt; After the big march and the even bigger vote, heroic Best For Britain march organiser &lt;strong&gt;Naomi Smith&lt;/strong&gt; and truly knackered journo &lt;strong&gt;Ian Dunt&lt;/strong&gt; join &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; in an echoey Portcullis House to work out exactly what happened, and what happens next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus, news from the soundsystem and the joyous street activities! Who says we can only do gloomy EmergencyCasts, eh? This one will put a smile on your face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember, it&#x2019;s an EmergencyCast recorded on lo-fi equipment so be prepared for rough and ready sonics.&#xA0;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;And here&#x2019;s Part Two of our live show from Monday 10 Dec, right in the middle of Theresa May&#x2019;s total retreat from reality. &lt;strong&gt;Dorian Lynskey, Ingrid Oliver, Ian Dunt&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ros Taylor&lt;/strong&gt; run through some post-Brexit scenarios, exchange Brexmas gifts, take audience questions&#x2026; and then run weeping to the bar. Listen and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This special podcast is &lt;strong&gt;live and unedited&lt;/strong&gt;, straight from the mixing desk. Special thanks to Simon Kitts and all at the Leicester Square Theatre for giving us a great evening at the end of a nerve-racking day.&lt;/p&gt; &amp;#10;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p style='color: grey; font - size: 0.75em; '&gt;See &lt;a style='color: grey; ' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://acast.com/privacy'&gt;acast.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; for privacy and opt-out information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;With the legality of prorogation being tested in the crucible of the Supreme Court, we welcome Good Law Project director and Remain legal vanguard &lt;strong&gt;JOLYON MAUGHAM QC &lt;/strong&gt;to the studio to discuss exactly what&#x2019;s at stake. If the Government wins this one, could future administrations simply suspend Parliament whenever it likes, as if in some authoritarian Hokey-Cokey?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the maddening detail of what would be required to implement Johnson&#x2019;s imaginary deal. What does the Lib Dems going broke for revoke mean for future dealings between the Remain parties? Is Jo Swinson out-Hulking the other party leaders? Does Corbyn&#x2019;s reiteration of Labour&#x2019;s neutrality in any future referendum actually mean anything? And Ian finally gets to discuss modern politics as explained by the character arc of the Incredible Hulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented and produced by Andrew Harrison with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt. Audio production by Mike Kemp for Soho Radio. &lt;strong&gt;Remainiacs is a Podmasters production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get every new episode of Remainiacs a whole day early when you back us on the &lt;a href="http://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Patreon crowdfunding platform&lt;/a&gt;.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week: Will that punishment beating for King In The North &lt;strong&gt;Andy Burnham&lt;/strong&gt; make ex-Red Wallers think again about their unwise pre-Christmas fling with raffish Londoner Boris Johnson? Brexit and Coronavirus merge into &lt;strong&gt;COVEXIT&lt;/strong&gt;, the uncontrollable MegaZoid of misery. Are &lt;strong&gt;Schr&#xF6;dinger&#x2019;s Brexit Talks&lt;/strong&gt; dead, alive, or both at the same time? And for the first time ever, a &lt;strong&gt;thrilling cliffhanger&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;no scrolling to the end&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Seeing Andy Burnham now is like running into an ex who&#x2019;s been working out. Like, YOU&#x2019;VE changed&#x2026;&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#x2013; Dorian Lynskey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;This government treats everything as a foam block they can just crash through.

But this Government is insane.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;Alex Andreou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listeners can get 10% off Ian Dunt&#x2019;s new book &lt;em&gt;How To Be A Liberal&lt;/em&gt; using &lt;a href="https://www.canburypress.com/discount/HTBAL10?redirect=/products/how-to-be-a-liberal-by-ian-dunt-hardback-isbn9781912454419" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;Keir Starmer, a man out standing in his field, and why you don&#x2019;t want to get on the wrong side of Big Donkey. Where do the hands of the &lt;strong&gt;EU Negotiations&lt;/strong&gt; Doomsday Clock stand? How are COVID and the increasingly perilous EU trade negotiations looking from Germany? &lt;strong&gt;Rachel Stern&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;a href="http://TheLocal.de" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;TheLocal.de&lt;/a&gt; joins us from Berlin to explain.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As MPs prepare to return to work, what should we look out for in the new parliamentary session? And after a summer of u-turns galore, what policy reversal will the Tories whip out next? Plus, political columnist STEVE RICHARDS joins us to discuss his book &#x2018;The Prime Ministers&#x2019; and to give his take on the best and worst leaders from Wilson to Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;When you&#x2019;ve won a landslide election, that gives you an authority to do what you want&#x201D; - Steve Richards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;In Boris Johnson we are dealing with someone completely different from Prime Ministers of the past&#x201D; - Steve Richards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Brexit will fascinate historians not just in 40 years&#x2019; time, but 200 years&#x2019; time." - Steve Richards&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Alex Andreou with Ian Dunt and Yasmeen Serhan.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;As the Tory leadership race is buried under an avalanche of dead cats, we&#x2019;re joined by political analyst &lt;strong&gt;Brian Klaas&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013; assistant professor of global politics at UCL, expert on authoritarianism, electoral malpractice and how democracies die, author of &lt;em&gt;How To Rig An Election&lt;/em&gt;, and host of the &lt;a href="https://www.powercorruptspodcast.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Power Corrupts podcast&lt;/a&gt;. What can the truth-lite, nonsense-heavy Trump nightmare tell us about the future of British democracy in the Age of Johnson?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus&#x2026; Why DID Johnson claim he makes toy buses for fun? Ian tells you how to destroy the &lt;strong&gt;GATT 24 argument&lt;/strong&gt; in less than 30 seconds. How Boris Johnson&#x2019;s June 26 2016 column was the ur-text of Brexit lies. The truth about our upcoming BIGLY trade deal with Trump. The perils of &#x2018;novelty bias&#x2019;. Is Anne Widdecombe coming to get Ian in the night? And how Johnson&#x2019;s inevitable humiliation could actually be Britain&#x2019;s route back to self-respect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;We all think these guys on the right are super-smart and one step ahead.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Tough week. Tension in the studio as we record this show on Wednesday afternoon while the crunch debate on the &#x201C;meaningful vote&#x201D; is taking place. Listen in for analysis on what it could mean, where we go next&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;and then stunned disbelief as Dominic Grieve folds at the last minute. Guess that&#x2019;s a case of &#x201C;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice&#x2026;&amp;nbsp;that&#x2019;s absolutely fine by me?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS after May promises to pay for that NHS budget hike with the imaginary, non-existent &#x201C;Brexit Dividend&#x201D; we ask is there anything left of the Conservative brand now that the Tories have given up on Toryism? We call out the disgraceful co-ordinated attacks on young Remain campaigners by Seamus Milne&#x2019;s social media army of hard left &#x201C;human meat puppets&#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;JAMES McGRORY of Open Britain&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to preview the &lt;a href="https://www.peoples-vote.uk/march" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;March for a People&#x2019;s Vote&lt;/a&gt; on Sat 23 June. See you there with banners flying. We&#x2019;ve been knocked down &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;but we&#x2019;ll get up again. They&#x2019;re never going to keep us down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;What the hell did plumbers do to this country to make Brexiters so angry at them?&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt. Producer: Andrew Harrison. Audio production: Sophie Black. Remainiacs is a Podmasters production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help us to #OwnTheRemoan!&lt;/strong&gt; Back the show in its battle to get some sense back into the Brexit debate and get smart Remainiacs merchandise too, at our &lt;a href="http://www.patreon.com/remainiacscast" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Patreon page&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.REMAINIACS.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;REMAINIACS.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theme music &#x2018;Demon Is A Monster&#x2019; used by kind permission of Cornershop.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the no-bullshit Brexit podcast&#x2026; Our special guest, Lewisham East MP and Remainer hero HEIDI ALEXANDER, on the Government&#x2019;s 58 hidden economic impact surveys. Why won&#x2019;t they release them? Plus: Ukip, Arron Banks and those allegations of campaign finance irregularities. The disconnect between voters and politicians. And are Leave voters really less educated than Remainers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;People voted to take back control. Instead they&#x2019;re getting a cover-up.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to help us #OwnTheRemoan?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Things are moving far too fast to wait &#x2019;til next Friday. Ros Taylor, Alex Andreou and guest David Allen Green gather in the studio to look at the legality of prorogation, the chances of beating it in the courts or elsewhere&#x2026; and the poor performance of Her Majesty The Queen.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s halfway through the election campaign&#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producer Andrew is away for Thanksgiving this week, so our regulars are off the leash and the metaphors get a little&#x2026; colourful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of updated tactical voting data, we discuss the possibilities that lie ahead on polling day and try to bring some cheer to proceedings while keeping references to &#x201C;flesh pi&#xF1;atas&#x201D; to a minimum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campaign speed bumps abound for the main parties, as Jeremy Corbyn is grilled by Andrew Neil in an interview Boris Johnson hasn&#x2019;t turned up for himself, while we assess presentational issues for Jo Swinson as leader of the Lib Dems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I think it&#x2019;s too late for the Lib Dems to recoil from the Revoke policy,&#x201D; &lt;/em&gt;says Naomi.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#x201C;What you&#x2019;ve got to do now is bed in and do it&amp;nbsp;passionately, and if you&#x2019;re going to do it, stick to it, and speak from the heart about why stopping Brexit is the best thing for this country."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#x2019;re also discussing the lack of reckoning over the sins of Empire that has in part led to the strain of British exceptionalism inherent in the Brexit campaign. Nice bit of lightness before the most important election of our lives, then.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, a second round of questions in our &lt;strong&gt;ASK REMAINIACS&lt;/strong&gt; election special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith, Alex Andreou and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Crisis? What, MORE crisis? How well is plucky Brexit Britain set up to cope up with the &lt;strong&gt;Coronacession&lt;/strong&gt;? (Spoiler: badly). Investigative academic &lt;strong&gt;Seth Alexander Th&#xE9;voz&lt;/strong&gt; shows the breathtaking power of untraceable dark money in UK elections &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;and how it helped the Tories knock down the Red Wall. The EU shames itself in the Greece-Turkey refugee crisis. Toilet paper: Britain displays its Bumkirk Spirit. And the clucking awful truth about &lt;strong&gt;chlorine chicken&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;The economy was screwed already. Boris bounce? Absolute rubbish. The economy has been flatlining.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#x2019;s REMAINIACS ASSEMBLE as all our regular panelists convene to &#x201C;celebrate&#x201D; a whole year in the Brexit time warp. Ian, Ros, Dorian, Naomi and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Peter listen back to our very first episode &#x2013; back when &#x201C;strong and stable&#x201D; was still a thing &#x2013; to ask, what has changed? What did we get right and wrong? Will Britain ever escape from the time loop that is Brexit? Will Britain ever escape from the time loop that is Brexit? And will Britain ever escape from the time loop that is Brexit&#x2026;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: Are the Tory Remainers finally about to grow a spine? If Benedict Cumberbatch is going to play Dominic Cummings, who should the BBC cast as Johnson, Fox and lumpen swamp creature Arron Banks? What are the most Brexity and Remainy movies of all time? And stay tuned to the end of the show for *&lt;em&gt;a twist that nobody was expecting&#x2026; *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Still, with just a few months to go, none of the parties have got their acts together.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remainiacs on a Friday, like it's 2017 or something?&lt;/strong&gt; As the clock ticks down to Zero Hour, will the Government&#x2019;s performative anti-Brussels bolshiness come back to bite it? What are the real factors that are making the GNU the most endangered animal in politics? &lt;strong&gt;Project Fear&lt;/strong&gt; comes true, but still can&#x2019;t cut through. How to shut up people who shout &#x201C;LISBON TREATY!&#x201D; as if it&#x2019;s some magic word to dispel all anti-Brexit argument. And what are we going to spend all that &lt;em&gt;Get Ready For Brexit&lt;/em&gt; ad money on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced and presented by Andrew Harrison with Alex Andreou, Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&#x2019;s podcast, Guardian columnist and former Russia correspondent RAFAEL BEHR&amp;nbsp;joins us to explain the mind-crushing complexity of Withdrawal Bill day. What happened, who won (if anyone) and where do we go from here? Did Theresa May play Dominic Grieve like a sucker? And if she did, can the Rebels come back at her in any meaningful way? (We recorded on Wednesday 13 before May &#x201C;allegedly&#x201D; went back on her word to Grieve regarding the Meaningful Vote. Update minicast coming soon).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: Inside the sleazy world of Arron Banks, Isabel Oakeshott and Andy Wigmore, a story featuring ACTUAL Moscow Gold! The looming clash between Imaginary Brexit and Real Brexit. And why the Tommy Robinson Gammon Riots in Whitehall are really, truly worrying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Tory rebels need to stop acting like time is on their side. It&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s on the Brexiters&#x2019; side.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt. Audio production: Jack Claramunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the no-bullshit Brexit podcast&#x2026; We talk to investigative journalist MIKE HIND about how automated social media is warping democracy, and what you can do to keep the bots at bay. Plus: Why Britain should be booming now, and why it isn&#x2019;t. How Labour Leave keep making progressive arguments for reactionary causes. And a nice big argument about poppy fascism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;There&#x2019;s so much stupidity out there it&#x2019;s hard to tell the bots from the real people.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to help us #OwnTheRemoan?

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuity Corbynism picks a fight with the Starmer Leadership in the aftermath of the antisemitism court settlement. Will anything ever end the party&#x2019;s Left-Right Infinity War? Plus: Brace yourself for a &lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;low quality, low profile&#x201D; face-saving Deal&lt;/strong&gt; with the EU. And special guest &lt;strong&gt;John Crace&lt;/strong&gt;, the Guardian&#x2019;s demob-happy parliamentary sketch writer, takes us through the highs (subs pls check) and lows of the Johnson Parliament so far.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Starmer has proved a lot more ruthless than anyone expected as leader.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ros Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;If Starmer&#x2019;s made a mistake it&#x2019;s treating Johnson like a ten-year old, when in fact Johnson&#x2019;s more like a toddler.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Crace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Keir Starmer, a former DPP, will have a fairly good idea of when a case ought to be stopped&#x2026;&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alex Andreou&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;If people are on their knees, Boris Johnson&#x2019;s buffoonish persona will not play well with them.&#x201D; &#x2013; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Crace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ros Taylor and Alex Andreou.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So it&#x2019;s come to this&#x2026; Boris Johnson finally gets to sit in the Big Chair. Where do we go from here? Can he turn Brexiter fantasy into governmental reality? Is there a real Awkward Squad assembling on the Tory backbenches? And how do we get through this new low with our sanity intact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus special guest &lt;strong&gt;Gavin Esler&lt;/strong&gt; talks us through his new book &lt;em&gt;Brexit Without The Bullshit&lt;/em&gt;, his short rollercoaster ride as a Change UK candidate, and the war of facts vs fiction that defines Brexit. Oh, and there is hope! Her name is Jo Swinson. Can the new Lib Dem leader turn the party&#x2019;s Remain bounce into more than just a one-issue advantage?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ros Taylor.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSH RELEASE FOR RELEVANCE:&lt;/strong&gt; The day after the May Deal finally fell to a record defeat (with an even worse vote than her projected result if she hadn&#x2019;t bottled it in December) Ian Dunt, Naomi Smith and Dorian Lynskey convene to ask what the hell is going on and how will it all end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Deal lies in tatters, special guest &lt;strong&gt;DAVID ALLEN GREEN&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;lawyer, writer, commentator and warrior monk of the British constitution &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;joins us to ask tough questions of the People&#x2019;s Vote and explain just how far back the Brexiters&#x2019; strategic awfulness goes. Hands up, who had &#x201C;the 1680s&#x201D; in the sweepstake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PLUS: Which of our panel would have voted for the May Deal if they were an MP? Will &lt;strong&gt;Plan B&lt;/strong&gt; just be Plan A in a fake moustache and glasses? Will anything ever penetrate Jeremy Corbyn&#x2019;s Reality Protection Field? And it&#x2019;s Ian&#x2019;s sweariest episode yet. We&#x2019;re sorry. He&#x2019;s very, very tired.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;Yesterday felt like being at the execution of Charles I.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s podcast is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

We&#x2019;re not sure where it came from but we thought it more important to get the show out than spend ages trying to remove it.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Corbyn has FINALLY come out in favour of &#x201C;a&#x201D; Customs Union. But are Labour&#x2019;s ideas just Tory cake-and-eat-it promises with red icing on top? And why is he still repeating the Big Bus Lie that we can fund everything with imaginary money returned from Brussels? Special guest HELEN LEWIS, deputy editor of the New Statesman, joins us to dissect Jezza&#x2019;s new-look Brexit policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Annoyingly, we recorded this one after May had dismissed the EU exit treaty draft out of hand. Grrr. Again.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus: The Irish Border problem that won&#x2019;t go away and the brazen idiocy of Boris Johnson&#x2019;s &#x201C;Oyster Card&#x201D; solution. Should Britain get a grip and stop worshipping Winston Churchill? Would you eat TRUMP BEEF? And discover how a single punch in a Commons bar led inexorably to the Brexit catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;For people like Liam Fox, Brexit is the abiding mission of their political lives. You&#x2019;d imagine they&#x2019;d have thought about it a bit more before now&#x2026;&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on the podcast that know clarity from carrots: end-of-career music hall turn Boris Johnson &#x201C;reaches out&#x201D; to Remainers by telling us to shut up and agree with him. The Government re-re-re-relaunches its Brexit policy &#x2013; again. Fish passports and foie gras. John McDonnell&#x2019;s simple solutions to complicated problems. Plus: Tariffs! Tariffs! Tariffs! Why do they matter and what will Brexit do to them? And are the great villains of fiction LEAVE or REMAIN?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#x201C;If goods can&#x2019;t cross borders, soldiers will.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week&#x2019;s REMAINIACS is presented by Peter Collins with Naomi Smith, Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;So much for the Special Relationship&#x2026; In an unprecedented week in which PM-to-be Boris Johnson effectively fired Britain&#x2019;s ambassador to the USA to placate a bullying Donald Trump, we look into Britain&#x2019;s humiliating future as a taker of orders from bigger international players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus independent-minded Labour MP for Ilford North &lt;strong&gt;WES STREETING&lt;/strong&gt; joins us to explain what the party&#x2019;s shift of Brexit policy means. Corbyn now says he wants another vote &#x2013; but would Labour really fight a General Election on leaving the EU? All this and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Do you understand that where this ends is Washington telling us what to do?&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Ingrid Oliver and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Having lost control of the virus, the economy and now the Conservative Party, can mojo-free COVID casualty Boris Johnson relaunch himself with a war on Lefty Luvvies? Behind the scenes, are we looking at an autumn Sunak vs Gove smackdown? Is the big winner of Donald Trump&#x2019;s COVID diagnosis really&#x2026; Donald Trump? And how to fight &#x2013; and win &#x2013; a culture war.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;History goes in the direction you fight for.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#x2013; Ian Dunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;You&#x2019;re more likely to have a criminal record than attend a party conference so yes, technically they&#x2019;re all deviants.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#x2013; Naomi Smith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;From cinemas to music to comedy, you can see a future where the government has turned the country into a cultural wasteland.&#x201D;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &#x2013; Ian Dunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listeners can get 10% off Ian Dunt&#x2019;s new book &lt;em&gt;How To Be A Liberal&lt;/em&gt; using &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.canburypress.com/discount/HTBAL10?redirect=/products/how-to-be-a-liberal-by-ian-dunt-hardback-isbn9781912454419" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Government launches yet another, definitely final campaign to sell the &#x201C;benefits&#x201D; of No Deal. What do we think of Britain&#x2019;s bold New Start into &#xA3;13bn of 1970s-style red tape and towering tariffs on food basics? Plus, concreting over the Garden of England: there is some corner of a Kent field that will forever be a giant lorry park. The return of &lt;strong&gt;Ian Dunt&lt;/strong&gt;. And Monarchy In The UK: With the Queen and Harry AWOL in moments of crisis and Prince Andrew &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; sweating now, is there any point to the Royals any more?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;I just wish we had SOME decent libertarians&#x2026;&#x201D; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x2013;&amp;nbsp;Ian Dunt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x201C;Why do we NEED the pomp and ceremony of the monarchy? Why do we need the spectacle?&#x201D; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#x2013; Ros Taylor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presented by Dorian Lynskey with Naomi Smith, Ros Taylor and Ian Dunt.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Wonders will never cease. All her avenues exhausted, Theresa May reaches out to the only person who can help in her hour of need. And that would be&#x2026; Jeremy Corbyn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week we look at the minefield that is the &lt;strong&gt;Theresa-Jezza Love-in&lt;/strong&gt;. Is compromise possible any longer in the snakepit of the Commons? Who will carry the can for Brexit if they pull it off? And what does this mean for Labour&#x2019;s General Election plans and the future of the two parties? As luck would have it we recorded right before Emily Thornberry launched her People&#x2019;s Vote challenge to Corbyn but what do you want from us? Absolute topicality?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also this week special guest &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TomKibasi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOM KIBASI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the Institute for Public Policy Research joins us for a cheerful &#x2013;&amp;nbsp;yes, cheerful! &#x2013; view of Brexit from the progressive end of things. He tells us why the real radicalisation of the Conservative party isn&#x2019;t anything to do with Brexit and says there was another big lie told during the Referendum: &#x201C;People were told not to risk something they never had.&#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a double whammy of left-of-centre optimism we talk to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rcbregman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUTGER BREGMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/utopia-for-realists-9781408890264/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Utopia For Realists And How We Can Get There&lt;/a&gt;. Universal income, a 15-hour work week and the end of &#x201C;bullshit jobs&#x201D; sounds great, but how does it relate to Brexit?

    <description>In October and November 1942, the Allies fought a famous battle against German and Italian troops close to the small Egyptian village of El Alamein. General Bernard Montgomery, the British commander, knew that victory was crucial. But his offensive was in danger of stalling almost as soon as it began. Witness speaks to Len Burritt who was then a 24 year old wireless operator with the British Seventh Armoured Division.

    <description>Thousands of Allied troops parachuted into the Nazi-occupied Netherlands in September 1944. At that point, it was the most ambitious Allied airborne offensive of World War Two. British, American and Polish troops were dropped behind German lines in an attempt to capture a series of bridges on the Dutch/German border. Mike Lanchin has spoken to Hetty Bischoff van Heemskerck who, as a young woman, watched the Allied paratroopers come down close to her home in the city of Arnhem.

    <description>On 17 June 1940, a packed British troopship was sunk off the coast of France by German bombers. The ship had just picked up thousands of British military personnel left behind in France after the evacuation of the army at Dunkirk. It's believed around 5,000 people lost their lives. It was one of the worst maritime disasters in British history and news of the sinking was initially supressed in Britain. Alex Last spoke to 99-year-old Ernest Beesley, a sapper in the Royal Engineers, who is among the last survivors of the Lancastria.

    <description>How sex, jazz and 'fake news' were used to undermine the Nazis in World War Two. In 1941, the UK created a top secret propaganda department, the Political Warfare Executive to wage psychological warfare on the German war machine. It was responsible for spreading rumours, generating fake news, leaflet drops and creating fake clandestine German radio stations to spread misinformation and erode enemy morale. We hear archive recordings of those involved and speak to professor Jo Fox of the Institute of Historical Research about the secret history of British "black propaganda".

    <description>In an act of defiance during World War Two, starving musicians in the besieged city of Leningrad performed Shostakovich's new Seventh Symphony. The piece was composed especially for the city, which had been cut off and surrounded by invading Nazi troops. During the siege an estimated one million civilians died from starvation, exposure, and the bombardment by German forces. Hear archive recordings of Ksenia Matus who played the oboe in the orchestra, and hear from Sarah Quigley, the author of a novel about Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony. Dina Newman reports.

    <description>In June 1942 the village of Lidice in German-occupied Czechoslovakia was completely destroyed in retaliation for the assassination of a top ranking Nazi. Adolf Hitler was so outraged by the murder of Reinhard Heydrich that he ordered that all the men from the village be shot, the women sent to concentration camps and the children 'placed in suitable educational establishments'. In the end most of the children were gassed and the women sent to a concentration camp. (Photo: The Skleni&#x10D;kov&#xE1; family in 1931.

    <description>During World War Two, Soviet propaganda promoted a heroic feat that never happened. It was the story of a small ill-equipped unit who destroyed over a dozen German tanks, delaying the German advance on Moscow. But it's unlikely that they destroyed a single tank, despite being widely promoted as heroes, during and after the war.

    <description>In June 1940, German forces, having swept across Belgium and Holland, and into France, were closing in on Paris. In the face of the German army, millions of French, Dutch and Belgians had taken to the roads in one of the biggest exoduses of people the world had ever seen. Witness talks to Daphne Wall, who lived in Paris in 1940 as a young English girl and whose family joined the exodus south as Paris fell.

    <description>In 1943, the Royal Air Force attacked a set of dams in Germany's Ruhr valley which were considered indestructible. Flying low and at night, the crews used special bouncing bombs to bring down two of their targets. The Dambusters mission was a huge propaganda success for Britain and later inspired a famous film. Simon Watts talks to Johnny Johnson, one of the few survivors of the raid.

    <description>The early 20th Century was a golden age for physics with pioneers such as Max Born, Robert Oppenheimer and Werner Heisenberg working together at Gottingen University in Germany. But the rise of Hitler forced Born and many other Jewish scientists to flee into exile. Max Born's son, Gustav, tells Louise Hidalgo about his memories of the period and his father's friendship with Albert Einstein. (Photo: A gathering of European scientists in 1927. Max Born is second from the right in the second row.)</description>

    <description>In September 1943, Partisan fighters in Italy began organising in large numbers to help the Allies defeat Nazi Germany and rid their country of the remnants of Benito Mussolini's fascist state. As World War Two drew to a close, there was vicious fighting in many villages between the Partisans and Italians still loyal to the dictator. Alice Gioia speaks to a brother and sister who both took part in the Partisan struggle. PHOTO: Italian Partisans celebrating victory, May 1945 (personal collection)</description>

    <description>In the early hours of 19th August 1942, a convoy of Allied ships approached the port of Dieppe carrying more than 6,000 troops. The mainly Canadian force was supposed to carry out a hit and run raid that would help the Allies learn and plan for the real invasion of occupied France later in the war. But almost immediately things started to go wrong. Ronald Miles, then aged 20, was a crew member on a landing craft. (Photo: Two German prisoners brought back from the Allied raid on Dieppe, blindfolded after landing. Credit: Keystone/Getty Images)</description>

    <description>In 1937, Hitler and the Nazi party organised a huge exhibition of modern art in Munich. It was designed to ridicule works of art which they disapproved of - they called it Degenerate Art. It went on to be one of the best attended modern art exhibitions of all time. Picture: Two men prepare to hang German Expressionist painter Max Beckmann's triptych 'Temptation' at the 20th Century German Art Exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries, London. The exhibition includes work by all the German artists pilloried by Adolf Hitler in the 'Degenerate Art' exhibition in Munich of 1937. (Photo by Topical Press Agency/Getty Images)</description>

    <description>In April 1945, thousands of Italians crowded into a Milan square to see the body of the wartime fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini. He, his mistress and his close associates had been shot by partisans, and their corpses strung up by their feet for all to see. We talk to the poet Franco Loi, who was in the crowd that day, and to an American journalist who has documented Mussolini's last days.

    <description>Soon after Hitler ordered the invasion of Hungary in March 1944, the Nazis began rounding up hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews. Most were immediately sent to their deaths in the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. David Gur was a member of the Jewish Hungarian underground, who helped produce tens of thousands of forged identification documents. These allowed Jews to hide their true identities and escape deportation to the death camps. Now 91 years old, David has been telling Mike Lanchin about his part in one of the largest rescue operations organised by Jews during the Holocaust.

    <description>In 1941, the deputy fuhrer, Rudolf Hess, flew out of Nazi Germany and landed in Scotland. Keen to study the psychology of the Nazi leadership, the British government sent a psychiatrist called Henry Dicks to examine Hess at a safe house in Surrey. Professor Daniel Pick, author of "The Pursuit of the Nazi Mind", retraces the encounter using BBC archive recordings and Dr Dicks' personal papers. The programme is adapted from "The Psychiatrist and the Deputy Fuhrer", first broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

    <description>In October 1991, an international protocol to protect the world&#x2019;s last wilderness, Antarctica, from commercial exploitation was agreed at a summit in Madrid. The agreement was the result of a long campaign by environmental organisations to stop oil and gas companies being allowed to explore the continent.

    <description>In the early 1950s, the leading British catering firm, J Lyons &amp; Co, pioneered the world's first automated office system. It was baptised LEO - the Lyons Electronic Office - and was used in stock-taking, food ordering and payrolls for the company. Soon it was being hired out to UK government ministries and other British businesses. Mary Coombs worked on the first LEO and was the first woman to become a commercial computer programmer. She tells Mike Lanchin about her memories of those heady days when computers were still in their infancy.

    <description>One of the toughest challenges facing Japan&#x2019;s economy is that its population is ageing rapidly and its workforce is shrinking dramatically. But a Japanese investment analyst, Kathy Matsui, came up with a visionary idea to help her country, and she even invented a new word for it: Womenomics. The answer, according to her, was to tap into the talent of half the population. Kathy Matsui speaks to Alejandra Martins. (Photo: Kathy Matsui. Courtesy of Goldman Sachs)</description>

She had moved to the UK from Jamaica just a few years earlier and quickly worked her way up the teaching profession. She faced racist threats when she first took up the post but refused to allow them to define her relationship with the children she taught. She spoke to Jonathan Coates about her life.

    <description>In 1980 the Iraqi strongman, Saddam Hussein, tried to launch his country's entry into the world of movie making. He spent millions of dollars on an epic movie called Clash of Loyalties, filmed almost entirely on location in Iraq, and staring some of Britain's leading actors , including Oliver Reed, Helen Ryan and James Bolam. But soon after shooting of the film began, war erupted between Iraq and neighbouring Iran. Mike Lanchin speaks to the film's Iraqi-born British producer Lateif Jorephani and the Iraqi actor, Fatima al Rubai, about the ambitious project. Photo Credit: Jorephani Productions</description>

    <description>Randy Weaver was a white separatist in Idaho in the north-west United States who was wanted by the government on firearms charges. When government agents approached his remote cabin on Ruby Ridge in August 1992, it was the start of an eleven day siege involving hundreds of police officers &#x2013; which ended with the deaths of Weaver&#x2019;s wife and teenage son, along with a US marshal. The incident would become a touchstone for the far right and a rallying cry for the American militia movement. Lucy Burns speaks to journalist Bill Morlin, who covered the siege for the Spokesman-Review newspaper. Picture: Randy Weaver (C) shows a model of his Ruby Ridge, Idaho cabin to US Senator Arlen Specter, R-PA, during Senate hearings investigating the events surrounding the 1992 standoff with federal agents (PAMELA PRICE/AFP via Getty Images).</description>

    <description>In 1973, an engineer called Marty Cooper made the world&#x2019;s first mobile phone call from a street in New York City. Cooper worked for a then tiny telecoms company called Motorola, but he had a vision that one day people would all want their own personal phone that could be reached anywhere. He talks to Louise Hidalgo. Picture: Martin Cooper in New York City in 1973 with the first prototype mobile phone (Credit: Martin Cooper)</description>

    <description>An insider's account of Project Babylon, the plan to build the largest gun in the world for Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The "Supergun" was the brainchild of Canadian artillery maverick, Dr Gerald Bull. He'd long wanted to build a gun capable of launching satellites into space. In the 1980s Saddam Hussein agreed to fund this plan. But was it a science project or a weapon? In 1990, the "Supergun" hit the headlines and it became an international scandal. Alex Last spoke to Chris Cowley an engineer who worked on Project Babylon,. Appropriately enough he has also become an author of thrillers. His latest book is called Without A Shadow.

    <description>In 1985 activists hand-stitched a giant quilt to commemorate friends and relatives killed by AIDS, and to campaign for more funding and research into the disease. It was the brain child of Cleve Jones, who explains to Rebecca Kesby what it was like to live through the HIV/AIDS epidemic in San Francisco. How the LGBT community had to pull together, as victims of AIDS were ostracised by the wider community during their worst moment of suffering. (Photo: A section of the AIDS Memorial Quilt.

    <description>In 1985 Australia's most famous natural landmark, Uluru, the huge ancient red rock formerly known as Ayers Rock, was handed back to its traditional owners, the indigenous people of that part of central Australia, the Anangu. But as one of the government officials involved in the negotiations for the transfer, former private secretary for aboriginal affairs, Kim Wilson, tells Louise Hidalgo, not everyone in Australia was pleased.

    <description>In October 2010, Haiti was hit by an outbreak of cholera, the first in recent history of the impoverished Caribbean nation. Nepalese peacekeepers belonging to the international MINUSTAH mission were blamed for introducing the deadly disease, but for many years the UN refused to accept any responsability. More than 10,000 Haitians have died from cholera, and thousands more were infected. The UN finally apologised to the Haitian people in December 2016. Mike Lanchin speaks to the French specialist in tropical medicine and infectious diseases, Dr Renaud Piarroux, whose investigation helped force the UN's hand.

    <description>In 1984, a 72-year-old grandmother became the first to try a new online shopping system, years before the arrival of the internet. Mrs Jane Snowball had been given new Videotex technology which allowed her to order her groceries using a tv and a remote control. The system was part of a community project to help the elderly and vulnerable in the English town of Gateshead. The technology was the brainchild of Michael Aldrich, head of the communications firm, Rediffusion (later ROCC). Alex Last spoke to John Phelan, who designed the system's online shopping application.

Whole families found themselves housed in barracks behind barbed wire fences. Former Star Trek actor, George Takei, was just a child when he was locked up in one of the camps. In 2010 he spoke to Lucy Williamson about his experiences there. This programme is a rebroadcast. Photo: Japanese American children on their way to internment camps.

    <description>In the 1960s five-year-old Jeryl Lynn Hilleman got ill with mumps. Her father Dr Maurice Hilleman took a swab from the back of her throat and used it to help create a vaccine for the disease - more quickly than any previous vaccine had ever been completed. During his decades long career Dr Hilleman worked on vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis and meningitis.

    <description>The working class woman who shook up the British theatre establishment in the 1950s and 60s. Joan Littlewood introduced improvisation and helped break down class barriers. She set up a theatre in a working class area in the east end of London which put on plays written by amateur writers and actors, many without classical training. She delighted in the fact that the laziest person in the company might be working class and the poshest the one scrubbing the stage. She went on to create successes such as 'Oh! What a Lovely War' and 'A Taste of Honey'. Claire Bowes has been talking to her friend and biographer, Peter Rankin.

    <description>In September 1519, a fleet led by the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan set off on what would be the first circumnavigation of the world. Magellan was the first navigator to find a route round South America, but he had to quell several attempted mutinies and he was eventually killed by tribesmen in what is now the Philippines. His circumnavigation was completed in 1522 by one of his subordinates, Juan Sebastian Elcano. Simon Watts tells Magellan&#x2019;s story through the book published by his on-board chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta. PHOTO: Magellan's fleet (Hulton Archive/Getty Images)</description>

    <description>In April 1970, hundreds of millions of viewers around the world tuned into TV coverage of the drama on board Apollo 13 as it attempted to return safely to Earth after a devastating on-board explosion. The drama revitalised interest in the NASA space programme, which had been dwindling after the first lunar landing a year earlier. Simon Watts talks to David Schoumacher, former Space Correspondent for America&#x2019;s CBS news, and to former CBS producer Mark Kramer.

    <description>On November 4th 1979 revolutionary students overran the US Embassy in Tehran and took everyone inside hostage. In February 1980 the students invited a humanitarian delegation from the US to visit them in Iran. The group were shown around Tehran to highlight the country's poverty. They were also allowed to meet some of the American hostages. Rabbi Hirshel Jaffe was a member of the delegation and Masoumeh Ebtekar was the spokesperson for the students. Rachael Gillman reports on a crucial moment in the relationship between the US and Iran, as part of the BBC Crossing Divides season, which brings people together across divides.</description>

    <description>The US presidential election of 2000 was one of the closest and most contested in history. It was more than a month before the result was decided after a Supreme Court decision. It all came down to the vote in Florida, a 'swing-state', where irregularities and technical problems added to the confusion. In the end it's thought there were just a few hundred votes in it, but years later, the result, and the handling of the election in the state, divides opinion. Callie Shell was the official photographer for Al Gore's presidential campaign and documented the dramatic events behind closed doors in pictures. She's been telling Rebecca Kesby what it was like to be there.</description>

    <description>In December 1975, four members of one of the IRA&#x2019;s deadliest units were chased by police through the streets of London before hiding out in a small flat owned by a middle-aged couple called John and Sheila Matthews. The resulting six-day siege was covered live on television and radio, and gripped Britain. It ended when Metropolitan Police negotiators persuaded the gunmen to leave the flat peacefully. Simon Watts talks to Steven Moysey, the author of the book and audiobook, The Road to Balcombe Street. (Photo: Police surrounding the flat in Balcombe Street. Credit: Press Association)</description>

    <description>In 1975, San Diego Zoo began placing tissue samples of rare animals in cryogenic storage for the benefit of future generations. Called the Frozen Zoo, the refrigeration system now contains the cells of more than 1000 species ranging from the white rhinoceros to the black-footed ferret. Scientists are now using the collection to try to save species threatened by extinction. Simon Watts talks to Dr Oliver Ryder, who has worked at the Frozen Zoo from the very beginning.

    <description>A boom in demand for sea cucumbers in Asia in the 1990s set off a confrontation between fishermen and conservationists in the waters off the Galapagos islands, where the protein-rich sea creature was found in abundance. The high price being paid for the sea cucumbers led to a gold rush on the South American archipelago, a chain of 21 islands home to many unique wild-life species. Mike Lanchin has been speaking to a Galapagos fisherman and a British conservationist, who found themselves on opposite sides of the dispute. (Photo credit: Getty Images)</description>

    <description>In June 1980, US media mogul Ted Turner launched the first TV station dedicated to 24 hour news, Cable News Network or CNN. Some were sceptical that there would be enough news to stay on air, others warned that the public wouldn't be interested in news 24 hours a day. But it marked a shift in broadcast journalism and paved the way for many more rolling news stations across the world. Rebecca Kesby has been speaking to Senior Executive at CNN, Rick Davis, about how 24 hour news has influenced politics and what role it has to play in holding those in power to account. Rick also takes us back behind the scenes to when he was an output producer on launch day, June 1st 1980.

    <description>A flightless bird, the dodo became extinct just decades after being discovered on the uninhabited island of Mauritius by European sailors. Because dodos couldn't fly they, and their eggs, were eaten by explorers and the cats and rats that came with them on board their ships. By the late 1600s there were none left. Simon Watts charts the demise and subsequent popularisation of the dodo. Image: An engraving of a dodo. Credit: Science Photo Library.</description>

    <description>The USA is the only rich democracy not to provide universal healthcare. After WW2 US President Harry Truman was horrified that only a fifth of all Americans could afford proper healthcare. Most middle class Americans had no private health insurance and many found medical fees unaffordable. He calculated that more than 300,000 people died every year because they couldn't pay for proper treatment. In 1945 he tried to persuade Congress to push through legislation for an insurance programme meaning all workers would pay for their healthcare through a monthly fee or tax. But the American Medical Association - representing doctors - employed a public relations firm to lobby against the move. Claire Bowes has been listening to archive material of Harry Truman and speaking to Jonathan Oberlander a Professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

    <description>The story of a scientist who helped solve a Cold War mystery involving flatulent fish and Soviet submarines. During the Cold War, foreign submarines infiltrated neutral Sweden's territorial waters. In response, the Swedish navy built up a secret database of tell-tale signs to detect the presence of lurking subs and conducted high profile submarine hunts. But the country's submarine scare continued even after the end of the Cold War. So in 1995, the Swedish government launched an investigation. Alex Last spoke to Swedish biologist, Dr H&#xE5;kan Westerberg, who discovered that one of Sweden's key indicators for submarines, was not what it seemed.

    <description>On October 13th 1990, the Syrian airforce pushed their most outspoken opponent in Lebanon, General Michel Aoun, to take refuge in the French embassy in Beirut, ending the last chapter of Lebanon's bitter 15-year civil war. Veteran Lebanese journalist Hanna Anbar told Louise Hidalgo about that day for Witness History. This programme is a rebroadcast.

    <description>In the months leading up to outbreak of World War Two in September 1939, some 10,000 unaccompanied children were sent by their parents out of Germany and Austria, to safety in the UK. Many of them never saw their families again. Dame Stephanie Shirley was just five years old when she and her older sister were put on a train by their mother in Vienna. She has been telling Mike Lanchin about arriving in a foreign land as a little girl. Photo:Getty Images</description>

    <description>On 20th April 2010, a deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico left 11 people dead. As the rig sank, the riser pipe connecting the platform to the oil well ruptured and began spewing vast amounts of crude oil into the sea. The broken pipe lay near the sea bed, 5000ft down. The well's operators, BP, tried and failed to stem the flow of oil. Soon a huge oil slick had developed threatening the ecosystem in the Gulf. After 87 days the well was finally capped. But by then more than 130 million gallons of oil had entered the marine environment. It was one of the worst environmental disasters in US history. Alex Last spoke to Dr Lisa Dipinto a Chief Scientist from the Office of Response and Restoration at NOAA, who worked on the impact of the spill.

    <description>American scientist Dennis Klatt pioneered synthesised speech in the 1980s. He used recordings of himself to make the sounds that gave British physicist Stephen Hawking a voice when he lost the ability to speak. Friend and colleague of Dr Klatt, Joseph Perkell, told Rebecca Kesby about the man who gave his voice to Prof Hawking allowing him to educate the world in science.

    <description>When the banned Polish trade union organisation, Solidarity, was legalised in April 1989 it was one of the first signs that communism was about to collapse in Eastern Europe. Within months Solidarity was leading a coalition government in Poland and soon afterwards the Berlin Wall fell. In 2015 Tom Esslemont spoke to the former Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz about the events of that historic year. This programme is a rebroadcast.

    <description>Although African Americans were guaranteed the right to vote by the constitution, many in the south were being denied that right. During the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s black voting rights activists had been beaten and killed but it was events in Selma Alabama in 1965 that outraged many Americans. In March 1965 hundreds of peaceful protesters were brutally beaten by Alabama state troops as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The bloodshed in Selma prompted President Lyndon B Johnson to push for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most significant pieces of legislation ever passed by Congress. The landmark Act was brought in to tackle racial discrimination during elections and to guarantee the rights of African Americans to vote. Farhana Haider has been listening to the archive.

    <description>Six Degrees was the first online social network, allowing users to connect with their real-world contacts by creating a profile within a database. It was created by entrepreneur Andrew Weinreich. But Six Degrees never achieved the scale of later social networks like Facebook or MySpace, and Weinreich sold the site in 1999. He spoke to Lucy Burns.</description>

    <description>By the 1980s a deadly cocktail of factory fumes and car exhausts had turned Mexico City into the world's most polluted city. Hundreds of thousands of people were falling ill each month, many of them children. The Mexican authorities came up with an ambitious plan to curb the use of each of the city's two million cars for one day a week. The scheme was an immediate success and has been copied in other major cities around the world. Ramon Ojeda Mestre, the environmentalist behind the Mexican initiative spoke to Mike Lanchin about overcoming fierce opposition to the plan. Photo: Cars driving through Mexico City.

    <description>In 1950, a 200-page-long directory called "Red Channels " was published in America. It was a list of people working in the media who were suspected of being Communists or Communist sympathisers. It ruined careers and sent actors, writers and directors into exile. Most of the people named in it are no longer alive. But Vincent Dowd has been speaking to former Hollywood actress Marsha Hunt who is still with us, aged 102.

    <description>An eyewitness account of how a poor, war-ravaged nation became a global economic powerhouse. We hear the memories of Dr Kongdan Oh, who grew up in South Korea in the 1950s, in the aftermath of the Korean War. The country had been left devastated by the conflict. Then, in the early 1960s, South Korea's new military leader, General Park Chung-hee, launched an ambitious national drive for rapid economic growth. For many, it marked the start of South Korea's economic transformation. Photo: South Korean labourers balancing baskets of coal, while working inside the grounds of a factory.

    <description>In the late 1970s toxic chemicals were discovered oozing from the ground in a neighbourhood in upstate New York. The neighbourhood was called Love Canal. Hundreds of houses and a school had been built on top of over 20,000 tonnes of toxic industrial waste. The disaster led to the formation in 1980 of the Superfund program, which helps pay for the clean up of toxic sites. Farhana Haider has been speaking to former Love Canal resident and campaigner Luella Kenny about her fight for relocation. Photo Pres. Jimmy Carter, Love Canal resident Lois Gibbs, Rep.

    <description>In January 2014 after decades of violent struggle, a peace deal was agreed in the Philippines between a Muslim separatist organisation and the government. The deal granted largely Muslim areas of the southern Mindanao region greater autonomy in exchange for an end to armed rebellion. Farhana Haider has been speaking to the government's chief negotiator Miriam Coronel-Ferrer about the difficulties posed by being a woman negotiating with a Muslim rebel group.

    <description>In 2005, South Africa set up the Missing Persons Task Team to trace and locate the remains of the hundreds, possibly thousands, who disappeared in "political circumstances" during the brutal years of white minority rule. Many were victims of the state security services. Some were victims of secret death squads which abducted and murdered opponents of the regime. Alex Last talks to the leader of the team, Madeleine Fullard, about her work and how the cases reveal the dark and complicated history of apartheid rule.

    <description>Amid the ongoing debate about how to handle historical monuments which commemorate colonialism and slavery, Witness History hears the story of a giant statue of an elephant in the German city of Bremen. The port city had played a significant role in Germany's colonial past, and after Germany lost its territories in Africa following the First World War the statue was built there in memory of the period. But in the 1980s, a group of anti-apartheid activists campaigned to raise awareness of Germany's colonial history - and to rededicate the elephant statue. Lucy Burns speaks to Professor Manfred Hinz, who was part of the campaign. Photo: Shutterstock - the anti-colonial elephant monument in Bremen, 08/07/2020</description>

    <description>In 1904, a left-wing American feminist called Lizzy Magie patented a board game that evolved into what we now know as Monopoly. But 30 years later, when Monopoly was first marketed in the United States during the Great Depression, it was an out-of-work salesman from Pennsylvania who was credited with inventing it. Louise Hidalgo has been talking to American journalist Mary Pilon about the hidden history of one of the world's most popular board games, and to the economics professor Ralph Anspach who unearthed the story.

    <description>In 2009, three American hikers were arrested and jailed after they crossed an unmarked border into Iran while on holiday in Iraqi Kurdistan. Sarah Shourd was released first and fought a long campaign to get her friends Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal released from prison in Teheran. Their freedom was eventually brokered by diplomats from Oman &#x2013; opening up a diplomatic channel between Iran and the US which was later used in their nuclear negotiations. Sarah Shourd talks to Simon Watts. PHOTO: Sarah Shourd, centre, with the mothers of Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal (Getty Images)</description>

    <description>A unique way of life came to an end in Hong Kong in 1993 when Kowloon Walled City was demolished. When the rest of Hong Kong was a British colony, the seven acres of the Walled City were still nominally under the control of mainland China &#x2013; but it became a lawless world of its own, a haven for gang crime and illegal dentistry. At one point it was one of the most of the most densely populated places the world has ever seen. Lucy Burns speaks to Albert Ng, who grew up in Kowloon Walled City, and urban designer Suenn Ho, who studied it before its demolition.

    <description>The British Prime Minister started expressing doubts about the European Union during a speech in the Belgian city of Bruges in 1988. The now famous "Bruges speech" is seen by many as the spark which ignited the anti-European movement within Britain's Conservative party. Susan Hulme has been speaking to Sir Stephen Wall who wrote an early version of the speech and to David McWilliams who was a student in the audience at the College of Europe when Mrs Thatcher spoke.

    <description>How the Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was negotiated to write off billions of dollars of debt, accumulated over two decades of civil war. Coming to power in 2006, Johnson Sirleaf had to govern the West African country with little tax revenue and owing large sums to countries and institutions it could never hope to pay back. Over four years, with intensive negotiations with multiple parties and even support from the Irish rock star Bono, in 2010 the World Bank and International Monetary Fund announced they would forgive 4.6 billion dollars of the country&#x2019;s debt.Bob Howard speaks to former president Johnson Sirleaf about the long road to debt forgiveness.

It was hoped that European countries would never go to war again, if they were tied together by economic interests. The treaty formed the basis for what is now the European Union.

    <description>In 2012 a stunning, secret collection of art was found in Germany. Much of it had disappeared during Nazi rule in the 1930s and 40s. It had once belonged to one of the Nazi's top art dealers, Hildebrand Gurlitt. It was found by chance in the Munich apartment of his elderly, reclusive son, Cornelius. It contained lost works by Renoir, Matisse, Chagal and the masters of the German expressionist movement. Many of the works had been confiscated during the Nazis "Degenerate Art" campaign in the late 1930s, when the Nazis stripped thousands of works of art from public display. Alex Last spoke to Dr Meike Hoffmann, an expert on Nazi art policy, who was one of the first to examine the collection. Photo: One of the art works discovered in the Gurlitt collection was Pferde in Landschaft (Horses in Landscape) by famous German expressionist Franz Marc.</description>

    <description>The black former soldier choked to death in handcuffs on the floor of a British police station in 1998. CCTV footage taken from the police station showed the 37 year-old father of two gasping for air as officers chatted and joked around him. It took 11 minutes for him to stop breathing. An inquest found he was unlawfully killed but no-one has been held accountable for his death. Farhana Haider speaks to Janet Alder about her long fight to get justice for her brother.

    <description>On Valentine's Day 1995, authors Sherrie Schneider and Ellen Fein published a dating handbook called The Rules: Time Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr Right. The book advised women that if they wanted to find a husband they should not approach a man first or pay for themselves on dates. Criticised in some quarters as anti-feminist, it soon became a bestseller, with celebrity fans from Beyonce to Meghan Markle. Lucy Burns speaks to Sherrie Schneider about creating a cultural phenomenon. (Photo: Groom and bride exchanging wedding ring. Credit: Wavebreakmedia/iStock)</description>

    <description>The author Ian Fleming created the fictional super-spy, James Bond, in the 1950s. Fleming, a former journalist and stockbroker, had served in British naval intelligence during the Second World War. Using interviews with Fleming and his friends from the BBC archive, Alex Last explores how elements of James Bond were drawn from Ian Fleming's own adventurous life.

    <description>In the grip of a drugs crisis, the country took a radical approach in 2001 and became the first country in the world to decriminalise all drugs for personal use. Drug abuse and addiction began to be seen as a public health issue, not a criminal offence. Initial resistance to the policy faded after statistics proved that treatment, rather than punishment, was reducing the number of deaths caused by drugs in Portugal. Dr Jo&#xE3;o Castel-Branco Goul&#xE3;o was one of the chief architects of the shift in policy. He's been explaining to Rebecca Kesby why Portugal had such a pronounced drug problem to begin with and how the shift in strategy helped to reduce it.

    <description>In November 1946, Emperor Hirohito proclaimed a new post-war constitution for Japan which contained clauses establishing women's rights for the first time. They were the brainchild of Beate Sirota Gordon, a young American woman working for the Allied occupying forces. Simon Watts tells her story using interviews from the BBC archives.

The Berlin Wall was built through its garden. Then after the reunification of Germany it was recognised as a historic monument and made into an education and reconciliation centre. Alex Stanger has been speaking to Thomas Harding whose great grandfather built the house, and who has written a children's book about its changing place in the world. Photo: The Alexander Haus today.

    <description>In 1986, the US Supreme Court heard a landmark case which would define sexual harassment as a crime in America. The lawsuit, brought by bank clerk Mechelle Vinson, established that abuse in the workplace was a breach of civil rights. It was built on pioneering legal scholarship by feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon, who talks to Sharon Hemans. PHOTO: Mechelle Vinson in 1986 (Getty Images)</description>

    <description>In February 1990, the Nasa space probe Voyager took a famous photo of Earth as it left the Solar System. Seen from six billion kilometres away, our planet appears as a mere dot lit up by the Sun, and the image is credited with giving humanity a sense of our small place in the Universe. Darryll Morris speaks to Nasa planetary scientist, Candice Hansen, who worked on the Voyager programme. The programme is a Made-In-Manchester Production.

    <description>In September 2009 the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, made a sudden return from exile, seeking refuge in the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital. Zelaya had been whisked out of the country at gunpoint after a military coup three months earlier. His unexpected return took the coup leaders totally by surprise. Mike Lanchin has been hearing from two men who spent several months holed up inside the embassy building alongside the Honduran leader.

But after the Allies suffered huge losses during the Battle of the Bulge, they were called on to volunteer for combat.

    <description>In the late 1960s Tanzania's first post-independence president, the charismatic Julius Nyerere, believed that endemic poverty in rural areas could only be addressed if peasant farmers relocated to larger villages and worked collectively. It was part of a new experimental form of socialism, known as Ujamaa. In 2016 Rob Walker spoke to two Tanzanians who remember it well. This programme is a rebroadcast.

    <description>The US first began sending troops to the UK in 1942 to help in the war effort. It is estimated that at least two million American servicemen passed through the UK during World War Two and tens of thousands of them were black. The African-American GIs stationed in Britain were forced by the American military to abide by the racial segregation laws that applied in the deep south of the US. But that didn't stop relationships developing between British women and the black soldiers, some of whom went on to have children. Babs Gibson-Ward was one those children. She has been speaking to Farhana Haider about the stigma of growing up as mixed raced child in post-war Britain. (Photo: Hoinicote House children, c.1948.

    <description>The Limits to Growth was published in 1972 and predicted global decline from 2020. It was based on a computer model which analysed how the Earth would cope with unrestricted economic growth. Researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology fed in huge amounts of data on population, pollution, industrialisation, food production and resources. They found that if the trends continued, the result would be a sudden and uncontrollable downturn beginning around 2020. Claire Bowes hears from one of the authors of the book, Professor Dennis Meadows. Image: Front cover of The Limits to Growth, published in 1972</description>

    <description>Many people were shocked when Winston Churchill's personal doctor published his memories of Britain's wartime leader in 1966. Churchill's family tried to halt the publication, but as historian Piers Brendon has been telling Vincent Dowd, the doctor, Lord Moran, had unique insights into the great man's behaviour.

    <description>Barbara Mensch recalls how she was hijacked and held in Jordan by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in September 1970. Barbara&#x2019;s plane was forced to fly to a disused British airbase in Jordan, whilst on the final leg of a flight from Tel Aviv to New York. She was imprisoned on board the TWA plane for almost a week and then held hostage in the Jordanian capital Amman for a further fortnight, as the so called Black September conflict erupted between militant Palestinian groups and the Jordanian Army.</description>

    <description>When an atomic bomb was detonated over the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945, hundreds of thousands of people were killed and injured. Despite many survivors believing nothing would grow in the city for decades, 170 trees survived close to the epicentre and are still growing 75 years later. Green Legacy Hiroshima is a project which sends seedlings from those trees around the world, spreading a message of hope. Rachael Gillman has been speaking to Teruko Ueno who survived the bombing of Hiroshima, and her daughter Tomoko Watanabe who is a co-founder of the project.

    <description>In August 1977, the racist National Front organisation planned to stage a march into Lewisham in South London at a time of high racial tension in the area. The National Front activists were met by a huge counter-demonstration organised by anti-racist campaigners &#x2013; in the clashes that followed, hundreds of people were arrested and injured before the National Front were forced to withdraw. The so-called Battle of Lewisham is now seen as having halted the rise of the far-right in British politics. Nacheal Catnott talks to Lez Henry, who grew up in Lewisham and witnessed the unrest. Produced by Eleanor Biggs. PHOTO: A police officer attempts to restore order in Lewisham in 1977 (Getty Images)</description>

    <description>One man's experience of the controversial US law that saw thousands locked up for life. Under the law in California, a third conviction for a felony offence would lead to a life sentence. At times in California, 45% of "three strikers" were African American. Many were sentenced to life in prison for non-violent or minor offences. Alex Last hears the story of Bilal Chatman, and his hopes for reform. Photo credit: Getty Images</description>

    <description>A team of American doctors, led by the distinguished physician Dr John Cutler, carried out secretive STD tests in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948. The doctors experimented on more than one thousand prisoners, sex workers, mental institution inmates and soldiers, injecting them without their consent with syphilis and gonorrhea. In some cases the victims were provided with penicillin to combat the diseases; in many others they weren't given anything. Mike Lanchin speaks to Susan Reverby, a medical historian, who discovered the original documents from the greusome experiments and helped get a public apology for the victims from the Obama administration in October 2010.

    <description>What it was like to be a child quarantined in a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients in the 1950s. Ann Shaw was nine when she was first admitted to the Craig-y-nos sanatorium in Wales and 13 when she was finally allowed home. Until antibiotic treatments came along, to stop the disease spreading, TB patients were kept apart from the general population and their families, often for years. This included babies and children, leaving many traumatised. Ann Shaw tells Louise Hidalgo about the half-life they lived in the sanatorium. Picture: boys on the balcony of the Craig-y-nos TB sanatorium; fresh mountain air was regarded as one of the best treatments for TB (Credit: from the private collection of the family of Mari Friend, a former patient at Craig-y-nos)</description>

    <description>The Stele of Axum, a 4th century Ethiopian treasure, was finally returned by Italy in 2005. It had been taken from the ancient town of Axum in northern Ethiopia by invading Italian fascist forces in 1937. The huge 24 metre tall stele was originally erected to mark the site of a royal tomb during the Kingdom of Axum. The Axumites were a powerful and sophisticated civilisation which emerged in northern Ethiopia more than 2000 years ago. Alex Last spoke to Ethiopian archaeologist Tekle Hagos of Addis Ababa University about the return of the great monument.

    <description>When Dr Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968, US school teacher, Jane Elliott, decided to try to teach her all-white class about racism. She decided to segregate them according to the colour of their eyes, and treated them differently. Although controversial from the start, the &#x201C;blue eyes/brown eyes&#x201D; teaching exercise has been adapted in schools and workplaces for diversity training ever since. Jane Elliott has been explaining to Rebecca Kesby why she still thinks the model has value today in defeating racial prejudice.</description>

    <description>A prison camp called Jaslyk opened in the desert in western Uzbekistan in 1999. Even by the standards of the Uzbek prison system it would become notorious for torture and human rights abuses, including reports of a prisoner being boiled alive. Journalist Muhammad Bekjanov was imprisoned in Jaslyk during the 18 years he spent in Uzbek jails. He speaks to Lucy Burns along with independent human rights observer Acacia Shields.

    <description>The Spanish town of Benidorm is now one of the world's most popular holiday resorts - receiving more than 10 million visitors a year. The hotels and skyscrapers are the vision of Benidorm's mayor in the 1950s and 60s, Pedro Zaragoza. Zaragoza personally convinced Spain's dictator, General Franco, to allow more tourism - and to allow sunbathers to wear the bikini. Simon Watts introduces the memories of Pedro Zaragoza, as recorded by Radio Elche Cadena Ser shortly before his death. PHOTO: A busy day in Benidorm (Reuters)</description>

    <description>In 1975 the Canadian oncologist Dr Vera Peters released ground-breaking data to prove that breast-conserving surgery could at times be as effective as having a radical mastectomy. Her findings were received with lukewarm support and even open opposition from many of her colleagues in the male-dominated medical profession. Mike Lanchin hears from Dr Peters' daughter, Dr Jennifer Ingram, about her mother's tenacious attempt to improve the well-being of breast-cancer sufferers.

    <description>In 1970 the American scientist, Norman Borlaug, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering work developing disease-resistant crops. At the time famine and malnutrition were claiming millions of lives across the world, particularly in South Asia. Dr Borlaug&#x2019;s work meant countries like India were able to become self-sufficient. Critics said the new grain varieties were too reliant on chemical fertilizers, but it&#x2019;s thought millions of lives were saved. Rebecca Kesby has been speaking to Professor Ronnie Coffman, student and friend of Norman Borlaug. (Photo: Dr Norman Borlaug in a field of wheat.

    <description>A US Marine's account of the massive US-led assault on the Iraqi city in November 2004. Amid post-invasion chaos in Iraq, the city was seen as a stronghold of insurgents. It was hoped the battle would be a turning point in the fight against the Iraqi insurgency. Alex Last spoke to Colonel Andrew Milburn, author of When The Tempest Gathers, who served as a US military advisor to a frontline Iraqi army unit during the battle.

    <description>Over a period of four years before his death in December 2004, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, the consort and husband of former Queen Juliana, gave a series of secret interviews to two Dutch journalists, on condition that nothing was published until after his funeral. In his conversations with the reporters, the German-born Prince sought to justify a string of extra-marital affairs and a million dollar bribe he had received in the 1970s from the American aircraft manufacturer Lockheed. Prince Bernhard also revealed for the first time the existence of an illegitimate daughter born as a result of an affair in the United States. The publication of the Prince's confessions by De Volkskrantran newspaper shocked the Dutch public, but were met with silence by the Palace. Mike Lanchin spoke to Jan Tromp, one of the journalists who spent hours interviewing the controversial Dutch royalty.

    <description>Michael Foale was on board the Mir space station when a resupply vessel crashed into it in June 1997. It was the worst collision in the history of space flight and it sent Mir spinning out of control. Michael was one of the three astronauts who had to try to repair the damage and get the space station back on course. In 2016 he told Alex Last about their ordeal. This programme is a rebroadcast.

    <description>Practising a religious faith in communist China has always been hard. Uighur Muslims face incarceration in re-education camps. But other Muslims have seen repression under communism too.Things were particularly tough in the 1960s during Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution. Then there was a brief period in the 1980s when the state seemed to ease its pressure on believers. Rebecca Kesby has been speaking to two Chinese Muslims about their lives and worship.

    <description>During the 20th century a British coal miner's son changed the world of art. Henry Moore revolutionised sculpture, altering the way we view the human figure and setting his works in natural landscapes. He became internationally renowned and by the 1970s hundreds of his sculptures could be seen outside government buildings, universities and museums around the world. His daughter, Mary Moore, remembers how initially his work shocked his teachers and art critics.

    <description>In 2009, Uruguay became the first country in the world to give a laptop computer to every child in state primary schools. At the time, only 10 per cent of poor Uruguayan children had access to IT, and the Plan Ceibal initiative is credited with transforming the lives of the students and teachers. Alejandra Martins talks to Miguel Brechner, the man behind Plan Ceibal, and Rocio Martinez, one of the first children to get a computer.

    <description>In May 1980 China allowed capitalist activity for the first time since the Communist Revolution, in four designated cities known as the Special Economic Zones. The most successful was Shenzhen, which grew from a mainly rural area specialising in pigs and lychees to one of China's biggest cities. In 2017 Lucy Burns spoke to Yong Ya, a musician who has lived in Shenzhen since the 1980s, and to ethnographer Mary Ann O'Donnell.

    <description>Of all the revolutions that swept across Eastern Europe 30 years ago in the winter of 1989, the over throw of Nicolae Ceau&#x219;escu and his wife Elena was the bloodiest. But few communist regimes had been as brutal as theirs, dominating every aspect of daily life. The uprising began in the western city of Timisoara, where a local pastor, L&#xE1;szl&#xF3; T&#x151;k&#xE9;s, took a stand against the authorities and his loyal parishioners stood with him. L&#xE1;szl&#xF3; T&#x151;k&#xE9;s tells Rebecca Kesby about the fall of the Ceau&#x219;escus and how the revolution started outside his own house.

    <description>In 1983 Chuck Hull invented the first 3D printer. It could produce small plastic objects directly from a digital file on a computer. Instead of using ink the printer used plastic - adding layer upon layer to create an object. At first no-one was interested but now 3D printing technology is used widely, both by amateur hobbyists and industry. It's been taken up enthusiastically in the medical world to help separate conjoined twins and the next step is to help create human tissue for regenerative medicine.

    <description>In August 1958 Britain was shocked by nearly a week of race riots in the west London district of Notting Hill. The clashes between West Indian immigrants and aggressive white youths known as Teddy Boys led to the first race relations campaigns and the creation of the famous Notting Hill Carnival. Using voices from the BBC archives Simon Watts tells the story. Photo: Street scene in Notting Hill at the time the race riots broke out in 1958. Credit: Getty Images.</description>

    <description>In 1990, South Africa became the first country in the world to ban skin-lightening creams containing the chemical compound hydroquinone. For years the creams had caused an irreversible form of skin damage called ochronosis for the black and Asian South Africans using the products. Rachael Gillman has been speaking to Dr Hilary Carman, one of the activists who worked to ban the creams and Dr Ncoza Dlova who became one of the country's first black dermatologists.

    <description>On 7 December 1990 the dissident Cuban novelist and poet Reinaldo Arenas killed himself in New York after years of suffering from AIDS. Before fleeing Cuba, Arenas had been jailed for his homosexuality, sent to re-education camps and prevented from writing. He left behind his autobiography - Before Night Falls - a powerful denunciation of Fidel Castro&#x2019;s regime which later became a successful film. Simon Watts talks to Arenas&#x2019; friend and fellow writer, Jaime Manrique. The recordings of Reinaldo Arenas in this programme are taken from BBC archive, and the documentaries Conducta Impropria and Seres Extravagantes. (Photo: Reinaldo Arenas.

    <description>In December 1988 the Brazilian environmental campaigner, Chico Mendes, was shot dead by cattle ranchers, unhappy at being prevented from exploiting land in the Amazon jungle. The 44-year-old leader of the rubber tappers union had become a powerful symbol of the struggle to save the Amazon and his death sparked renewed interest in environmental issues world-wide. Mike Lanchin has been hearing from the anthropologist Mary Allegretti, who was a close friend of Mendes and worked alongside him in the jungle. Photo: Chico Mendes and his family.

    <description>New laws were used to stop nightclubs and discos from banning black and ethnic minority customers in 1978. The first club to be taken to court was a disco called Pollyanna's in the city of Birmingham. The Commission for Racial Equality ruled their entry policy racist. David Hinds, vocalist for the reggae band, Steel Pulse, spoke to Farhana Haider for Witness History in 2015 about the racism in Birmingham's club scene in the 1970s.

    <description>Wilfred Owen died just a few days before the end of World War One but his poetry ensured he would be remembered. Little is known about the man behind the poems but his younger brother Harold spoke to the BBC about him in the 1960s. Vincent Dowd pieces together a picture of the young soldier-poet using the BBC's archive, Owen's letters home, and by speaking to Jean Findlay, biographer of CK Scott Moncrieff, the translator of Proust, who fell in love with Wilfred Owen.

    <description>The passenger train service between India and Bangladesh was resumed after more than 40 years. The train service had been suspended after the 1965 war between India and Pakistan of which Bangladesh was then a part. Partitioned in 1947, Bengal was divided in half between Hindu majority India and Muslim majority East Pakistan. Families were torn apart. East Pakistan later become Bangladesh after gaining independence in 1971. The Maitree or Friendship Express was the first passenger train service to connect the two Bengals in 43 years. Farhana Haider has been speaking to Dr Azad Chowdhury who was on board the inaugural train journey.

    <description>Ground-breaking work by developmental psychologist Professor Uta Frith has revolutionised our understanding of autism. Beginning in the 1960s, Professor Frith's research has overturned the long-held belief that autism was a social or emotional disorder, showing instead that it's the result of physical differences in the brain. Uta Frith has been talking to Louise Hidalgo. Picture: Uta Frith at her desk at the Medical Research Council Developmental Psychology Unit in London in the late 60s/early 70s (exact date unknown). From the personal collection of Uta Frith.</description>

    <description>The rainforests of Sarawak in Malaysia on the island of Borneo are some of the richest and most biodiverse ecosystems on earth - but for decades they've been under threat from commercial logging, permitted by the Malaysian government. In the 1980s, local people from the Penan and Kelabit ethnic groups began to fight back against the logging, setting up blockades and appealing to international environmental groups for support. Their campaign would make headlines around the world. Lucy Burns speaks to activist Mutang Urud, who helped organise the blockades and later went on a world tour to attract attention to their cause.

    <description>In the early 1980s deaf children in Nicaragua invented a completely new sign language of their own. It was a remarkable achievement, which allowed experts a unique insight into how human communication develops. Mike Lanchin has been speaking to American linguist Judy Shepard-Kegl, who documented this process and says "our belief is that you are born with a language-ready brain".

    <description>In the late 1990s, whistle-blowers implicated UN peacekeepers and international police in the forced prostitution and trafficking of Eastern European women into Bosnia, which was just emerging from a bitter civil war. Louise Hidalgo has been talking to one of those who sounded the alarm, British human rights lawyer, Madeleine Rees, who was then working for the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bosnia.

    <description>Whales were being hunted to extinction, when in 1967, a biologist called Dr Roger Payne realised they could sing. It changed the perception of whales and helped found the modern conservation movement. Claire Bowes spoke to Dr Payne about his discovery in 2017. This programme is a rebroadcast.

    <description>The US tracked down the al Qaeda leader to a city in northern Pakistan in May 2011. Special operations troops were sent to capture or kill bin Laden in a top secret raid in the dead of night. The Americans didn't tell their Pakistani allies about the raid beforehand. Gabriela Jones has been speaking to Nicholas Rasmussen who was in the White House situation room with President Barack Obama and US military chiefs as the raid took place. Photo: Osama bin Laden.

    <description>On 16 September 2007 private security guards employed by the American firm Blackwater opened fire on civilians in Baghdad's Nisour Square. Seventeen Iraqis were killed, and another 20 injured. The Blackwater guards, who were escorting a convoy from the American embassy, claimed that they had come under attack from insurgents, but eye-witnesses and Iraqi offficials quickly dismissed that version of events. Mike Lanchin has been speaking to Mohammed Kinani who was driving through the area at the time, and whose 9-year-old son Ali, was shot dead by the Americans.

    <description>In 2004 feminist campaigners in Turkey forced a radical change in the law on crimes against women. The overhaul of the country's 80-year-old penal code meant a redefinition of crimes such as rape and sexual assault; references to chastity, honour and virginity were also removed from the legislation. It was a major victory for a group of women who had been pressing for reform for years and was also one of the conditions for Turkey's accession talks with the European Union. Mike Lanchin has been speaking to Pinar Ilkkaracan, who led the successful campaign for legal change. (PHOTO: TARIK TINAZAY/AFP via Getty Images)</description>

    <description>Former Berlin resident David Bowie was among the performers at a pop concert in West Berlin in 1987 credited with helping to create the atmosphere that led, two years later, to the fall of the Berlin Wall. During the three-day concert, there were riots in East Berlin as East Berliners were prevented by police from gathering near the Berlin Wall to listen. And German journalist Christoph Lanz tells Louise Hidalgo it was the first time shouts were heard of 'the wall must go'.

    <description>Zainab Salbi grew up in the inner social circle of the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, in the 1980s because her father worked as Saddam&#x2019;s personal pilot. It was a world of apparently glamorous parties on the River Tigris, but where the slightest falling-out with the dictator could lead to execution. After years of psychological pressure, Zainab&#x2019;s family got her out of Saddam&#x2019;s Iraq by setting up an arranged marriage for her in the US. She tells her story to Susan Hulme.

    <description>On December 31 1991 the two warring parties in El Salvador's brutal civil war agreed to end the fighting. Left-wing FMLN rebels pledged to disarm and demobilise all their fighters, in exchange for the US-backed government and military carrying out sweeping political and security reforms. The Salvadoran peace process was heralded as a major victory for UN diplomacy. Its top negotiator, the Peruvian Alvaro de Soto, tells Mike Lanchin about his role in the long road to peace in El Salvador.

    <description>When the Islamic State group took over Mosul in Iraq in 2014 they flooded the internet with propaganda, claiming life under IS was fantastic. One historian living in the city decided to post a counter-narrative online. Omar Mohammed set up "Mosul Eye" to expose the atrocities and failings of IS fighters, but it was at great risk to his own safety. Omar tells Rebecca Kesby how he posted news from Mosul to the outside world from right under the noses of the Islamic State group. He says he felt it was his duty to tell the real story.

    <description>In 1976 South Asian women workers who had made Britain their home, led a strike against poor working conditions in a British factory. Lakshmi Patel was one of the women who picketed the Grunwick film-processing factory in north London for two years, defying the stereotype of submissive South Asian women. They gained the support of tens of thousands of trade unionists along the way. Lakshmi talks to Farhana Haider about how the strike was a defining moment for race relations in the UK in the 1970s.

    <description>Following the violent military coup that overthrew Chile's socialist government in 1973, the new regime led by General Augusto Pinochet began a radical overhaul of the economy. It was based on a free-market economic plan created by a group of economists known as the Chicago Boys. Mike Lanchin has been speaking to one of them, Rolf L&#xFC;ders.

    <description>A poor single mother of three, Carolina Maria de Jesus lived in a derelict shack and spent her days scavenging for food for her children, doing odd jobs and collecting paper and bottles. Her diary, written between 1955 and 1960, brought to life the harsh realities faced by thousands of poor Brazilians who arrived in cities like S&#xE3;o Paulo and Rio looking for better opportunities. Her daughter, Vera Eunice de Jesus Lima, speaks to Thomas Pappon about how the book changed her family's life. (Photo: Carolina Maria de Jesus in the Canind&#xE9; Favela.

    <description>The Harkis were Algerian Muslims who volunteered to fight with France in Algeria's war of independence. When the conflict came to an end in 1962 and France was forced to abandon its former colony, thousands of its Harki allies were left to face persecution and brutal repression. Serge Carel was an Algerian Harki who joined the French army when he was just 18 years old. When the independence war ended, he was imprisoned and tortured by the country's new rulers. He's been telling Mike Lanchin about his ordeal. Photo: Harki recruits in the French army in Algeria (courtesy of Serge Carel)</description>

    <description>Priests reacted with horror when a South Indian actress, Jayamala, admitted she had inadvertently touched a statue of a god at the Sabarimala temple in Kerala - a Hindu holy site. The priests had purified the temple and said that women of childbearing age were banned from setting foot inside it. But a young lawyer, Bhakti Pasrija, decided to take on the religious authorities in the courts. She has been telling Iknoor Kaur what happened next.

    <description>In 2012, archaeologists from the University of Leicester discovered the lost grave of Richard III under a car park in Leicester. Richard was the King of England more than 500 years ago and for centuries was portrayed as one of the great villains of English history. He was killed in 1485 leading his army in battle against a rival claimant to the throne, Henry Tudor. After the battle, Richard III corpse was stripped naked, paraded around down, before being hastily buried in a church within a friary in Leicester, which was later demolished. Alex Last spoke to Dr Richard Buckley who led the archaeological project to find the remains. Photo: Remains of King Richard III being studied at The University of Leicester (BBC)</description>

    <description>In 1990 the Indian government introduced an affirmative action plan that had been lying unimplemented for a decade. The Mandal Commission recommended guaranteeing a percentage of government jobs to lower caste Hindus. It's implementation was an attempt by the government to quell the rise of Hindu nationalism. But the move proved controversial from the outset and led to weeks of student protests across India. &#xA0;Farhana Haider has been speaking to a retired superintendent of police, Dilip Trivedi who remembers the implementation of the report and its aftermath.

    <description>After decades of campaigning in Japan, the pill was finally legalised in 1999. In contrast the male impotency drug Viagra was approved for use in just six months, and legalised before the contraceptive pill for women. Politician Yoriko Madoka pushed hard for the right to take the pill and told Rebecca Kesby that sexism and male dominance in Parliament is why it took so long.

NASA tried desperately to control Skylab's descent, but large fragments hit south-west Australia instead of falling into the sea. Simon Watts heard from two residents of Esperance, a remote coastal town which bore the brunt of the impact.

    <description>The Empress Dowager Cixi ruled China for 47 years until her death in 1908. But it wasn't until the 1970s that her story began to be properly documented. She'd been vilified as a murderous tyrant, but was that really true or was she a victim of a misogynistic version of history? Prof Sue Fawn Chung was the first academic to go back to study the original documents, and found many surprises. She tells Rebecca Kesby the story of "the much maligned Empress Dowager".

    <description>In 1963 a small group of British black activists started a pioneering protest against racism within the local bus company in Bristol. It had specified that it did not want to employ black bus drivers. Inspired by the example of the US Civil Rights Movement the boycott ended in victory and led to the passage of Britain's first anti-discrimination laws. Paul Stephenson and Roy Hackett spoke to Louise Hidalgo in 2013 about their part in the protest. Photo: Park Street in Bristol in the early 1960s. (Credit: Fox Photos/Getty Images)</description>

    <description>The story of how a car that had originally been the idea of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was saved by a British army officer at the end of World War Two. In August 1945 the British Army sent Major Ivan Hirst to take control of the giant Volkswagen plant in Germany, built under the Nazis to produce 'people's cars' for the German masses. Ivan Hirst persuaded the British authorities to allow production to restart of the Volkswagen Beetle, which Hitler had had designed before the war as an affordable car for ordinary Germans and which would become one of the most successful cars in the world. Louise Hidalgo has been listening to archive of Major Hirst talking about that time.

    <description>On 16th October 1995 hundreds of thousands of African American men marched on Washington D.C. in an attempt to put black issues back on the government agenda and to present a positive image of black men. Aquila Powell &#x2013; 23 at the time &#x2013; was one of the few women who attended the march. She was working for the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation and trying to encourage attendees to register to vote. She talks to Ben Carter about her recollections of that day.

    <description>In the early 1980s, thousands of young people in communist East German became punks, attracted by the DIY culture and anti-establishment attitude. But the East German secret police the Stasi believed the subculture represented an existential threat to the state and tried to crush the movement. Lucy Burns speaks to former punk J&#xFC;rgen Gutjahr, aka Chaos, and Tim Mohr, author of "Burning Down The Haus: Punk Rock, Revolution and the Fall of the Berlin Wall."

    <description>In 2007, the mysterious loss of commercial honey bees in the United States made headlines around the world. Researchers called the phenomenon Colony Collapse Disorder. The sudden loss of bee colonies had serious implications for modern agriculture as the commercial honey bees were used to pollinate many crops. The crisis served to highlight the broader threat to bees and other crucial pollinators from disease, pesticides and the destruction of habitat. Alex Last has been speaking to Dr Dennis vanEngelsdorp, who studied Colony Collapse Disorder. Photo:Honey bees on a hive. (Getty Images)</description>

    <description>When Montreal's police force went on strike for one day over pay in 1969, there was looting and rioting in the streets. But the city's problems leading to the unrest had been building for more than a decade. Organised crime, militant separatists and commercial rivalries all erupted on 7th October, just as police officers decided to protest that their pay was much lower than officers in other Canadian cities. Sidney Margles was a local reporter, and described the scene, and the underlying problems, to Rebecca Kesby. (PHOTO: The scene at the Murray Hill Limousine garage as rioting left several buses on fire and damage to property, following a police strike in Montreal. Getty Images)</description>

    <description>The only part of the British Isles to be occupied during World War Two was liberated when the German army surrendered in May 1945. The Channel Islands are situated just off the coast of France, and yet even after the Allies had invaded the French coast, they remained under German occupation. Barbara Frost was 17 years old when liberation came. She has been telling Robbie Wojciechowski about life under occupation. Photo: Barbara a year after the war ended.

    <description>The National Trust was founded in 1895, and initially focused on preserving Britain's rural heritage. But their mission expanded in the 1930s to include protecting stately homes - the grand old houses of the British aristocracy - which were under threat. Higher taxation meant many landowners were struggling to maintain their properties while sweeping social changes made it harder for them to find servants. James Lees Milne worked for the National Trust's Country House Scheme, travelling around the country to see which houses the Trust should acquire, and writing a diary about his experiences which paints a vivid picture of a disappearing world of elderly aristocrats living in genteel poverty in crumbling country houses. Lucy Burns presents interviews with James Lees Milne from the BBC archive. (Photo: The National Trust country house Kingston Lacy.

    <description>The USA dropped its first atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6th 1945. Three days later a second atomic bomb was detonated over Nagasaki. The explosion was bigger than the blast at Hiroshima and killed 70,000 people. Louise Hidalgo introduces recordings from the BBC archive. (Photo: Mushroom cloud in the sky.

    <description>In the 1970s, an American engineer Jack Cover designed a new experimental stun gun. He called it a Taser. But the device only really became popular when it started to be used by US law enforcement agencies. The Los Angeles Police Department were among the first to use the device. Retired police Captain Greg Meyer was then the young officer given the task of evaluating non-lethal weapons for the LAPD. He tells Alex Last about the origins of the Taser and its dramatic impact on the streets. Photo: Jack Cover with an early version of his Taser. The gun has a flashlight atop and below are two cartridges each containing two darts which can be fired a distance of 15 feet with a stunning 50,000-volt shock.</description>

    <description>In February 1987, a small Native American tribe from California won a landmark ruling at the US Supreme Court granting them the right to conduct gambling activities on their reservation. The campaign by the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians led to the creation of a multi-billion-dollar gaming industry on Indian land across the United States. Simon Watts talks to former Cabazon Band president, Brenda Soulliere, and their lawyer, Glenn Feldman. PHOTO: An Indian-run casino in California (Getty Images)</description>

    <description>After Germany's surrender to Allied forces in May 1945 Soviet soldiers occupied the German capital Berlin. For ordinary German citizens it was a time of fear and uncertainty. The city had been reduced to rubble and for women in particular, the presence of Soviet troops was terrifying. In 2011 one German woman told her story of rape by a Red Army soldier to Steve Evans. This programme is a rebroadcast. Photo: A young Soviet soldier and a German woman struggle over a bicycle - Berlin 1945. Credit: Keystone/Getty Images.</description>

    <description>In 2004, a German aid agency ship, Cap Anamur, was sailing to the Suez Canal, when it came across 37 Africans on a sinking rubber boat. The captain, Stefan Schmidt, rescued the men and headed for a port in Sicily to drop them off. But for almost 2 weeks, Italy blocked the ship from entering port and when the ship was finally granted permission to dock, Captain Schmidt and two others were arrested and prosecuted by Italian authorities for aiding and abetting illegal immigration. The case made headlines around the world and was a foretaste of an increasingly hostile European policy towards refugees and migrants trying to reach Europe by sea. Alex Last has been speaking to Captain Schmidt about his memories of the incident. (Photo: the German aid agency ship Cap Anamur in 2004.

    <description>Asthma affects more children than any other non-communicable disease - and it was a teenager who first asked her father "why can't they put my asthma medication in a spray can like hairspray?". Luckily her father ran a pharmaceutical company and got a team of scientists to work on the idea. Charlie Thiel is the one surviving member of the team. The chemist helped create a drug formulation of fine spray that reached further into the lungs than any previous treatment. Claire Bowes hears from him and his colleague Stephen Stein who has helped him document his story. Photo: Girl using metered dose inhaler 2001 (BBC)</description>

    <description>In the 1800s cholera was a mysterious disease killing millions around the world. No-one knew how to stop it till an English doctor, John Snow, began investigating the outbreak of 1854. At a time before germ theory was properly understood, many public health experts thought disease was carried on what they called "bad air". John Snow was alone in thinking cholera was spread through contaminated water and by the time of his death - in 1858 - his theories had still not been fully accepted. Claire Bowes spoke to Dr Nigel Paneth, a biographer of John Snow, about the skills he brought to the developing science of epidemiology.

    <description>In the 1960s doctors began ground-breaking work into using several toxic chemicals at once to treat cancer. Combination chemotherapy, as it was called, would revolutionise cancer survival rates, particularly for Hodgkin Lymphoma, until then a virtual death sentence. Louise Hidalgo has been talking to the doctor who played a key part in that breakthrough, clinical oncologist, Vincent DeVita who has spent his more than 50-year career trying to cure cancer.

    <description>When the crew of Apollo 11 returned to earth after their historic mission to the Moon, they were immediately placed in quarantine for 3 weeks. It was done to protect the Earth from the dangers of possible lunar alien life. Dr William Carpentier was the flight surgeon for the Apollo 11 mission and was placed in quarantine with the crew to monitor their health and check for any signs of alien life. He talks to Alex Last about his memories of working with the Apollo programme and life in quarantine.

    <description>How the timber industry fuelled a brutal civil war in West Africa. In the late 1990s, timber companies worked closely with Liberia's warlord-turned-president, Charles Taylor. In return for money and support for his militias, the regime allocated huge swathes of the country's valuable rainforest to timber companies for logging. A group of young Liberians started to document what was happening. Alex Last has been speaking to the award winning activist, Silas Siakor, whose work led to a UN ban on Liberian timber exports.

    <description>Scientists believe that the biggest living organism on Earth is a fungus. But the heaviest organism, and the most massive organism, is a tree, or rather a giant colony of quaking aspen tree stems which has been growing across a hillside in the west of America for thousands of years. The colony - called Pando - was first discovered in the late 1960s. But it wasn't until many years later that scientists proved it was one genetic entity. Two of the scientists involved in researching Pando's story have been speaking to Louise Hidalgo about what they found out.

    <description>American Sidney Rittenberg first met Mao Zedong in the 1940s during the final years of China's civil war and before Mao's victory over the Nationalist forces. Already a committed socialist, Rittenberg had been stationed in China during WW2 but decided to stay on and fight alongside Mao's Communists. In 2013 he spoke to Rebecca Kesby about his memories of one of the world's great revolutionaries. Photo: a poster of Chairman Mao in Beijing in the 1960s. Credit: AFP.</description>

    <description>A people&#x2019;s movement called Jana Andolan brought an end to Nepal&#x2019;s absolute monarchy in the spring of 1990. Political parties worked together with students, workers and civil society groups to organise strikes and street protests &#x2013; but although the king eventually agreed to their demands, it was the beginning of a long period of political instability. Lucy Burns speaks to activist and writer Devendra Raj Pandey about his memories of the first Jana Andolan.

    <description>In April 1977 a group of women in Argentina held the first ever public demonstration to demand the release of thousands of opponents of the military regime. It was the start of a long campaign by the women, who became known as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. In 2017 Mike Lanchin spoke to Mirta Baravalle who has spent decades searching for her missing daughter and son-in-law, and for the grandchild she has never met.

    <description>The artist Christo died on May 31st 2020. Famous for wrapping landmarks in fabric and plastic, one of his most ambitious projects was the former German parliament building which sat on the border between East and West Berlin. It had been gutted by fire in 1933 and extensively damaged during the Second World War. In June 1995 Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude completed the monumental public art project which was seen by more than five million people and became a symbol for Berlin&#x2019;s renewal after the collapse of communism and the reunification of Germany. Christo spoke to Lucy Burns in 2019. This programme is a rebroadcast. Picture: view of west and south facades of Wrapped Reichstag, Berlin 1971-1995 by Christo and Jeanne-Claude.

She was born to former slaves in the USA and was orphaned at seven but against all the odds she went on to create her own business selling black hair-care products. By the time of her death in 1919 she'd become a famous philanthropist and civil rights campaigner. Claire Bowes has been speaking to her great great granddaughter A'Lelia Bundles.

    <description>In the 1960s, doctors in Northern Ireland launched the world&#x2019;s first mobile coronary emergency service using a new invention &#x2013; the portable defibrillator. The defibrillators &#x2013; which initially worked off ambulance car batteries - saved dozens of heart attack victims every year. Modern versions are now commonly seen and used in places like offices and shopping malls. The man behind the portable defibrillator was Belfast hospital doctor Frank Pantridge. Simon Watts tells his story using the BBC Northern Ireland archives. PHOTO: A defibrillator in use (Science Photo Library)</description>

    <description>In 1966, an all-black team went head-to-head with an all-white team for the National College Basketball championship - one of the biggest prizes in American sport. To much surprise, the African-Americans of Texas Western College defeated the University of Kentucky, then the number one team in the country. The game is now regarded as breaking the colour barrier in US basketball. In 2016 Nija Dalal-Small spoke to Nevil Shed, one of that groundbreaking Texas Western team. The programme is a Sparklab Production for BBC World Service. PHOTO: Texas Western celebrate their victory in 1966 (Getty Images)</description>

    <description>In November 1989 Salvadoran government soldiers dragged six Jesuit priests from their beds and murdered them along with their housekeeper and her teenage daughter. The Salvadoran government tried to blame the killings on left-wing rebels, but one woman provided key testimony that contradicted the official version, at great personal danger. Lucia Cerna tells her story to Mike Lanchin (Photo: a plaque commemorating the murdered priests in San Salvador- courtesy of David Mee)</description>

    <description>In 1991, Palermo businessman Libero Grassi published an open letter in Sicily&#x2019;s main newspaper denouncing the Mafia for constantly demanding extortion payments. Grassi was hailed as a hero, but his public refusal to pay was intolerable to the Mafia and a few months later he was executed in person by one of Cosa Nostra&#x2019;s top bosses. Libero Grassi&#x2019;s defiance is credited with inspiring a new grass-roots movement among businesses in Sicily that stands up to the Mafia. Simon Watts talks to his daughter, Alice Grassi.

    <description>Prosecutor Gian Carlo Caselli explains how leading Italian politician Giulio Andreotti was put on trial in Sicily in September 1995, accused of collusion with the Mafia. Andreotti had been prime minister seven times and journalists dubbed it the trial of the century. Bob Howard has been hearing from Gian Carlo Caselli about compelling evidence that Andreotti had met the Mafia kingpin Stefano Bontade and even knew in advance of the planned assassination of the president of the Sicilian regional government, Piersanti Matarella.

    <description>For more than 20 years, people in Belarus have been protesting against the authoritarian rule of President Alexander Lukashenko - who's been dubbed Europe's last dictator. Lukashenko came to power in a landslide election victory in 1994 but he soon changed the constitution to give himself sweeping new powers. He has remained in office ever since, winning elections which observers say are rigged. Opponents of the regime have faced harassment, violence and arrest. Some are believed to have been kidnapped and murdered by the state. Alex Last has been speaking to the exiled dissident and co-founder of the Belarus Free Theatre, Nikolai Khalezin, about the origins of the protest movement in Belarus.

    <description>Hear first hand accounts from the doomed Antarctic expedition which became a legendary story of survival. In 1914, polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton led an expedition to become the first to cross the Antarctic continent. But before they could land, their ship, SS Endurance, became trapped in pack ice and sank. Marooned on a floating ice field, Shackleton and his men, embarked on an epic odyssey to reach safety. Alex Last has been listening to BBC archive interviews with the survivors.

    <description>Thousands of East Germans fled to the West in the summer and autumn of 1989, before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Many of them sought refuge in the West German embassy in Prague, where they camped in the grounds and slept in stairwells and corridors, fed by the Red Cross. On September 30th, West German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher announced that they were free to travel to West Germany. Hubert and Susanne Kuhn lived in the embassy with their three children for three months. They spoke to Lucy Burns about their experiences.

    <description>In 1983 French president Francois Mitterand commissioned a major renovation of Paris' most famous art museum, the Louvre. But the resulting great glass pyramid, designed by American architect IM Pei, caused a storm of controversy, dividing Parisian public opinion as the Eiffel Tower had done a century earlier. Louise Hidalgo talks to IM Pei's colleague and friend, Yann Weymouth, who worked with him on what is now recognised as one of the great landmarks of the city.

    <description>On 11th February 1990 anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela walked free after spending 27 years in a South African jail. It was a day that millions of black South Africans had been waiting for and marked the beginning of the end of white rule. Fellow activist Valli Moosa remembers that day, and the hasty preparations to make it possible and tells Louise Hidalgo how things almost didn't go to plan.

    <description>Hindu extremists demolished a 16th century mosque in the Indian city of Ayodhya in December 1992 prompting months of communal violence across India. Photojournalist Praveen Jain witnessed rehearsals for the demolition the day before the activists stormed the mosque. He has been talking to Iknoor Kaur about what he saw.

    <description>In 1988, a group of Jewish feminists demanded the right to pray as freely as Jewish men at one of Judaism&#x2019;s holiest sites. They called themselves the &#x2018;Women of the Wall&#x2019;. The organisation is made up of every Jewish denomination including reform, conservative and orthodox Jews. Its focus is one of the holiest sites in Judaism - the Western Wall in Jerusalem. Rachael Gillman has been speaking to Anat Hoffman, one of the founding members of 'Women of the Wall'. (Photo: Members of 'Women of the Wall' praying at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, holding their prayer shawls. Getty Images.)</description>

    <description>An exhibition about the role of the German army the Wehrmacht during the Second World War caused a scandal when it launched in Hamburg in March 1995. &#x201C;War of Annihilation: Crimes of the Wehrmacht 1941-1944&#x201D; was a key moment in Germany&#x2019;s reassessment of its Nazi past &#x2013; but it was highly controversial. Lucy Burns speaks to curator Hannes Heer.

    <description>Prince Harry and Meghan&#x2019;s announcement that they will step back from their royal duties is not the first time the British royal family has tried to reform itself from within. In 1992 Queen Elizabeth had what she called her &#x201C;annus horribilis&#x201D; . It was the year that her sons Prince Charles and Prince Andrew both separated from their wives, while her daughter Princess Anne got divorced - and it was also the year that Windsor Castle caught fire. The Way Ahead group was set up by senior members of the royal family and some of their closest advisors to make sure that Britain&#x2019;s monarchy stayed relevant in the modern age. Lucy Burns speaks to Charles Anson, who was the Queen&#x2019;s press secretary at the time. (Photo: Queen Elizabeth II makes her "annus horribilis" speech at London's Guildhall, November 1992.

    <description>A group of feminists working under the name &#x201C;Jane&#x201D; carried out underground abortions in 1960s Chicago &#x2013; when abortions were still illegal in most of the US. Initially they gave abortion counselling and put women who wanted to terminate their pregnancies in touch with doctors who would perform the procedure. But when they discovered that one doctor they had been working with was not medically qualified, the women started to perform the abortions themselves. Martha Scott was a member of the group &#x2013; she received an abortion through the service, learned to perform abortions, and was one of the Janes arrested when they were busted by the police. She tells Lucy Burns about her experiences. Photo courtesy of Martha Scott</description>

    <description>During the early years of Cultural Revolution in China, all European music was banned. Even enjoying traditional Chinese music and art was illegal. Anyone found with old instruments or recordings could be imprisoned. But that didn&#x2019;t stop some musicians and enthusiasts from playing or listening to the music they loved, sometimes as an act of rebellion. A favourite during those times in China was the German composer &#x2013; Ludwig Van Beethoven. Conductor, Jindong Cai tells Rebecca Kesby how he decided to become a musician after listening to an illegal recording of one of his symphonies.

    <description>A group of Californian nuns left their convent and set up their own independent community in 1970. They&#x2019;d been inspired by the social change they saw around them in Los Angeles in the 1960s, and the Pope's promise to modernise the Catholic Church. They wanted to stop wearing their traditional habit and abandon their set prayer times, but their conservative cardinal refused to discuss change. So three hundred of the sisters left to set up their own lay community &#x2013; the Immaculate Heart Community, which is still running today. Former Sister Lucia Van Ruiten tells Witness History about the crisis they caused in the Catholic church. (Photo: Nuns from the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary play guitars at the Mary's Day parade, 1964. Courtesy of the Immaculate Heart Community)</description>

    <description>The Black Panther Party hit the headlines in the late 1960s with their call for revolution. But they also ran a number of "survival programmes" to help their local communities - the biggest of which was a project providing free breakfasts for schoolchildren. Reverend Earl Neil was one of the organisers of the first Free Breakfast for Children programme at St Augustine's Church in Oakland, California. He speaks to Lucy Burns.

The much-feared Stasi agents had kept files on millions of their fellow citizens. Soon people were searching the archives.

    <description>Holidaymakers arrived at the first Club Med resort on the Spanish island of Majorca in summer 1950. The French company - full name Club M&#xE9;diterran&#xE9;e - was founded to offer a new kind of post-war holiday by Belgian water polo player G&#xE9;rard Blitz, who believed that "the time to be happy is now". The facilities were initially rudimentary, with guests sleeping in huts and sharing tables at meals - but the all-inclusive holiday model they pioneered soon spread all over the world. Lucy Burns speaks to Pierre-Xavier B&#xE9;cret, whose parents worked on that first Majorca holiday and went on to be involved with Club Med for many years.

    <description>In 1628, at the height of Sweden&#x2019;s military expansion, the Swedish navy built a new flagship, the Vasa. At the time it was the most heavily armed ship in the world. But two hours into its maiden voyage, it sank in Stockholm's harbour. It remained there for more than three hundred years, until its discovery in 1961. Tim Mansel hears from the former Swedish naval officer, Bertil Daggfeldt, about the day that the warship was recovered in near-perfect condition.

    <description>A deadly new form of haemorrhagic fever was discovered in the small town of Marburg in West Germany in the summer of 1967. The first patients all worked at a factory in the town which made vaccines. In the course of their work they had all come into contact with blood or tissue from monkeys from East Africa who were infected with a disease similar to Ebola. Lucy Burns speaks to virologist Werner Slenczka and former laboratory worker Frederike Moos about their experiences of the outbreak.

    <description>During World War Two, thousands of Chinese sailors and engineers served in the British Merchant Navy, keeping supplies flowing into the port of Liverpool and risking their lives in crossings of the Atlantic. Many settled in the port city and started families with local women but, after fighting ended in 1945, the British authorities began forcing them to leave. Simon Watts talks to Yvonne Foley, whose Chinese father was pressured to return to Shanghai, never to be seen again. PHOTO: Chinese sailors in Liverpool in 1942 (Getty Images).</description>

    <description>Franklin McCain was one of four young black men who took a stand against racial segregation in the USA in 1960. They sat down at a "whites only" lunch counter and asked to be served. When they were asked to leave, they refused, and soon their quiet protest was attracting attention from around the country. In 2011 Franklin McCain spoke to Alan Johnston about that time. This programme is a rebroadcast. Photo: Franklin McCain in 2010. Credit: Getty Images.</description>

    <description>A former governor of Punjab, Sir Michael O'Dwyer, was killed by an Indian immigrant in London in 1940. The assassin, Udham Singh, said he was avenging the deaths of hundreds of civilians who had been fired on by colonial troops in Amritsar in India in April 1919. When he was put on trial at the Old Bailey, he gave a defiant speech against colonial rule. Sajid Iqbal has been speaking to Avtar Singh Jouhal who campaigned to have Udham Singh's courtroom speech made public. Photo:An Indian man takes a photograph of a painting depicting the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar. The Amritsar massacre, also known as the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, took place on April 13, 1919 when British Indian Army soldiers on the direct orders of their British officers opened fire on an unarmed gathering killing at least 379 men, women and children, according to official records.

    <description>Five 'aquanauts' became the first women to front a mission for America's space agency, Nasa, in 1970. But their mission was underwater rather than in space. They spent two weeks being continuously monitored on camera in an undersea habitat. When they emerged from the experiment they were given a ticker tape parade and invited to the White House. Laura FitzPatrick has been speaking to Alina Szmant one of the aquanauts.</description>

    <description>In the 1990s Britain closed down many of its long-stay hospitals and asylums and their patients were sent to new lives in the community. But the transition wasn't always easy. Some people had suffered abuse and found it hard to adjust to life outside.

But two hours later all of the jumbo jet&#x2019;s engines shut down and no one knew why. The plane had flown into the ash cloud of the erupting volcano, Mount Galunggung, without realising it. Darin Graham speaks to retired Captain Eric Moody, who flew the plane that night.</description>

    <description>In April 1955, more than 100,000 children in America were inoculated with a defective batch of the brand-new polio vaccine. Because of a manufacturing mistake at a small company called Cutter Laboratories, the children were given live polio virus; around 160 were permanently paralysed and 10 died in the worst disaster in US pharmaceutical history. Simon Watts talks to Anne Gottsdanker, one of the victims of what became known as the Cutter Incident. PHOTO: Anne Gottsdanker with her father Bob Gottsdanker in 1956 (personal archive)</description>

    <description>In the 1940s, British gentleman explorer Wilfred Thesiger travelled extensively in one of the world's harshest environments - the Empty Quarter of Arabia. Thesiger lived with nomads in order to cross a desert that was then considered a place of mystery and death. He captured a final glimpse of their way-of-life before the arrival of the oil industry, and was inspired to write the classic travel book Arabian Sands. Simon Watts introduces recordings of Wilfred Thesiger in the BBC archive. PHOTO: Wilfred Thesiger (Pitt Rivers Museum via Bridgeman Images)</description>

    <description>In 2009 a paedophile was convicted with the help of a new form of identification - hand analysis. Dame Sue Black of Lancaster University explains how her team developed this tool and how criminal courts in Britain first responded to the evidence. She says vein patterns as well as scars and skin creases suggest hands may eventually be found to be as identifiable as fingerprints. Photo: Courtesy of Lancaster University</description>

    <description>In the 1970s, scientists in China used ancient traditional medicine to find a cure for malaria. Artemisinin was discovered by exploring a herbal remedy from the 4th century, and can cure most forms of malaria with very few side effects. It has saved millions of lives all over the world. Rebecca Kesby talks to Professor Lang Linfu, one of the scientists involved. PHOTO: Professor Lang Linfu (family archives)</description>

    <description>In the summer of 1967 more than 100 cities in America were caught up in riots. US Senator Fred Harris urged the President, Lyndon B Johnson, to investigate the causes. He set up the Kerner Commission and appointed Fred Harris as one of 11 members to find out why America was burning. The final report shocked many Americans when it blamed white racism for creating and sustaining black ghettos. It said the US was dividing into two separate and unequal societies - one black and one white. Claire Bowes has been speaking to former US Senator Fred Harris.

    <description>In August 1952, the Blegdam Hospital in the Danish capital Copenhagen was overwhelmed by hundreds of seriously ill polio patients. During the first weeks of the epidemic over 80 percent of the patients died, most within days of admission. The patients, who were mostly children, were dying of respiratory failure. Desperate for a solution an anaesthetist, Bj&#xF8;rn Iben, came up with a strategy that led to today&#x2019;s ventilators and revolutionised medicine. Farhana Haider has been speaking to Anne Holton who was a medical student at the time of the polio epidemic and helped treat patients.

    <description>After four white policemen were acquitted of killing a black man - Miami rioted. Citizens took to the streets on the night of May 17th 1980. The unrest lasted for three days. 18 people died, hundreds were injured, and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage were done to property. Sheila Cook has been hearing from Lonnie Lawrence who was a childhood friend of the dead man, but also a spokesman for the police force involved.

Thousands of American servicemen were killed or injured in the attack, which severely damaged the US Pacific Fleet. The next day, President Franklin Roosevelt declared war on Japan and America entered World War II. Adolph Kuhn was a US Navy mechanic stationed at Pearl Harbor when the bombs began to fall.

    <description>A so-called Social Purification project led to thousands of ordinary citizens being imprisoned under the military government in South Korea in the 1980s. Under the pretence of clearing the streets of vagrants and undesirables, people were sent to camps disguised as 'social welfare centres' where many of them suffered torture, forced labour, and physical and sexual abuse.

    <description>Just one month after gaining independence there was an uprising in Zanzibar in 1964. It was billed as a leftist revolution but the worst of the violence was ethnically targeted. Zanzibar&#x2019;s complex history meant the islands were home to a very diverse population, and the legacy of the slave trade had left deep scars and lingering resentment. Ahmed Rajab was a student in 1964 and remembers the night the revolution broke out. He&#x2019;s been telling Rebecca Kesby what it was like, and how it was a Ugandan man, John Okello, not a Zanzibari who lead the uprising. (PHOTO: Ugandan revolutionary and self-styled Field Marshal John Okello (1937 - 1971), leader of the Afro-Shirazi anti-Arab coup in Zanzibar which led to the country's independence, circa 1964.

A Swedish diplomat and member of the Swedish royal family, Count Bernadotte was killed by Jewish extremists four months after being appointed to try to bring peace to what was already proving to be one of the most intractable conflicts in the world. Louise Hidalgo has been talking to his son, Bertil Berndotte, about the count and his mission. Picture: Count Folke Bernadotte (centre foreground) in a jeep in Haifa on September 15th 1948.

    <description>The UK was one of the first in Europe to declare it would ban lead from petrol after a successful campaign showing it was poisoning children and leaving them permanently brain damaged. But it took until the year 2000 to finally remove leaded petrol from sale. Lead was first added to petrol in the 1920s to make the fuel run more efficiently. The latest figures show only three countries worldwide still sell leaded petrol. Claire Bowes spoke to Dr Robin Russell Jones from the "Campaign for Lead Free Air" about the battle to show that lead from petrol was dangerous. (Photo: a petrol pump in the UK.

    <description>The story of Dr. Semen Gluzman, a Ukrainian psychiatrist, who took a stand against the psychiatric abuse of political dissidents in the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, Soviet authorities had many dissidents declared mentally ill and confined them to special psychiatric hospitals for 'treatment'. In the 1970s, a young Ukrainian psychiatrist, decided to write a counter-diagnosis of one of the most famous of these incarcerated dissidents. For this, he would pay a high price. Alex Last speaks to Dr Semen Gluzman about his struggle to oppose Soviet punitive psychiatry. Photo: Semen Gluzman in 1989.(Gluzman)</description>

    <description>The Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark civil rights-era electoral law was designed to protect African-American and other minority voters. It was introduced to remove the many obstacles that were in place to prevent African-Americans from being able to vote. Many states, particularly in the south, used intimidation, local laws and so-called literacy tests to prevent black people from being able to register to vote. In 2010 Shelby County in Alabama attempted to overturn a key part of the law. In 2013 the US Supreme Court upheld their challenge. Now voters who are discriminated against bear the burden of proving they are disenfranchised.

Then in the 1950s many of them moved back again.

    <description>Between the late 1990s and 2002 there were more than 150 bomb attacks in the South African city of Cape Town. The authorities blamed them on a group known as Pagad - People Against Gangsterism And Drugs. But no one was ever convicted of the bombings.

    <description>The Cuban-American Dolores Prida wrote with a distinctive voice in her plays, newspaper columns and as an agony aunt in the Latina magazine. She challenged perceptions of how Latin Americans should be viewed in the US. When she died in 2013, President Obama paid tribute to her "conviction, compassion and humour."

    <description>During times of crisis in the UK, World War Two is often remembered as a period when the country rallied together to fight a common enemy. British politicians still refer to the so-called "Blitz Spirit" when calling for national unity. But as Simon Watts has been finding out from the BBC archives, there was a crime wave during the war years, with a massive increase in looting and black marketeering.

    <description>In September 1984, the famous Spanish matador, Francisco Rivera, also known as Paquirri, was gored to death by a bull during a fight in the small town of Pozoblanco. The bravery he showed during his final moments turned Paquirri into a legend. In 2013 Simon Watts spoke to El Soro, a matador who shared the bill that fateful day, and to Muriel Finer, an American journalist married to a Spanish bullfighter.

    <description>The WHO was first proposed as part of the new United Nations programme to reform the post-war world. The idea for an international health organisation to help promote good health globally was put forward by a member of the Chinese delegation, Szeming Sze. His memoirs reveal the political difficulties which dogged the process and his son remembers his passion for the project. We also hear from historian, Professor Theodore M Brown on what was really going on behind the scenes. Photo: Official logo of the World Health Organisation 1950 (Getty Images).</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;In December 2017 the famous porn star August Ames committed suicide in a park in the San Fernando Valley. It happened a day after she&#x2019;d been the victim of a pile-on, via Twitter, by fellow porn professionals - punishment for her tweeting something deemed homophobic.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A month later, August&#x2019;s husband, Kevin, asked writer Jon Ronson to tell the story of how Twitter bullying killed his wife. What neither Kevin nor Ronson realized was that Ronson would soon hear rumors and secrets hinting at a very different story - something mysterious and unexpected and terrible.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In&#xA0;&lt;em&gt;The Last Days of August&lt;/em&gt;, Ronson unravels the never-before-told story of what caused this beloved 23-year-old actress&#x2019; untimely death.

    <description>Tracy Brabin has had an unlikely route into politics. A successful actor for decades, she won&#xA0;Batley and Spen's by-election following the murder of Jo Cox by a far-right extremist. She talks to Krishnan about her transition into the political world, how potent a threat she thinks the far-right poses and why she thinks funding the arts can bring opportunity to former industrial towns like hers. This episode was recorded prior to the European election results.</description>

    <description>Laura Bates founded the Everyday Sexism project in 2012, long before the Me Too movement gained traction. It was a space where women could share their stories of sexual assault and highlight how normalised it had become. She talks to Krishnan about where the feminist movement is post-Me Too, why she reluctantly thinks gender quotas in the workplace are necessary and how we should be talking about sex and harassment in schools.</description>

    <description>Daniel Forrester is an American entrepreneur and political commentator. He also happens to be Iain Dale&#x2019;s best friend. They talk about the power of friendship, meeting your heroes, their relationships with their fathers and how they&#x2019;ve stayed friends despite rarely seeing each other. It&#x2019;s the kind of emotional and personal conversation that only best friends can have. Expect a few revelations, a lot of laughs and also a few tears (from both of them) along the way.</description>

    <description>James McGrath is a Senator in the Upper House of the Australian Parliament, representing Queensland. He started out in political life in Westminster, working for the Conservatives and then becoming Deputy Director of Boris Johnson&#x2019;s first London mayoral campaign. He gives some very honest analysis of Boris Johnson&#x2019;s qualities and failings, goes into detail about the art of political campaigning, and has some interesting thoughts on Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and Malcolm Turnbull and the viscerality of Australian politics.</description>

    <description>Four years ago former Tory MP Harvey Proctor was accused by a man the police called &#x2018;Nick&#x2019; of sexually abusing him as a teenager. &#x2018;Nick&#x2019; also accused Edward Heath, Leon Brittain and Field Marshall Lord Bramall of abusing him too. Harvey Proctor&#x2019;s house was raided, he lost his job, his house and his livelihood. Iain interviewed him several times on LBC at the time and commissioned his book &#x2018;Credible &amp; True&#x2019;. Eventually the Metropolitan Police admitted that Harvey had no case to answer and they launched criminal proceedings against &#x2018;Nick&#x2019;, real name Carl Beech. At the end of July he was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Harvey Proctor&#x2019;s story doesn&#x2019;t end there. In midAugust Harvey came into the LBC studio. You will hear how the case has affected him and what he plans to do now, as well as his views on the behaviour of the Metropolitan police and about deputy Labour leader Tom Watson. At times, it&#x2019;s an emotional listen.</description>

    <description>Hi Full Disclosure fans&#xD; &#xD; LBC have a new podcast we think you&#x2019;ll enjoy - Hosted by legendary reporter John Sweeney, Hunting Ghislaine is a 6 part series about Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of a disgraced billionaire and the former partner of a super-rich paedophile who killed himself while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.&#xD; &#xD; After hiding for almost a year, she now finds herself facing multiple charges for helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually exploit and abuse under-age women which could lead to her spending the rest of her life in jail.&#xD; &#xD; In this new podcast series, Hunting Ghislaine, reporter John Sweeney investigates a fairy story which happens the wrong way round, of how a princess ends up accused of being the monster and no-one at all ends up happily ever after. First Episode available 19th November. Listen on Global Player or wherever you get your podcasts</description>

But late last year, he hung his hat over the party&#x2019;s Brexit stance and inability to handle anti-semitism. This week, in his first in-depth discussion since standing down, Tom talks to James about the highs and lows of overseeing Her Majesty&#x2019;s opposition.</description>

    <description>Oscar-nominated actress, Lesley Manville, joins James O'Brien this week for an in-depth look at a career in acting. Since leaving school at 15, Manville has been a regular haunt of the West End - only recently breaking Hollywood. Despite her stardom, she still takes the bus and is now on a campaign against becoming the 'poster girl' for the older female actor. You might know her for playing Margaret Thatcher - but as this podcast-exploration shows, her politics don't quite match the role.</description>

    <description>This week, we're talking politics; specifically: the politics of Coronavirus. We're doing our bit by staying indoors, but are the Government holding up their side of the bargain? Are they providing enough PPE? Are they providing enough tests? Are they providing economic stability? All this, and more, in this week's Full Disclosure. &#xD; Don't forget you can e-mail the show on coronacrisis@global.com</description>

    <description>This week, we're talking politics; specifically: the politics of Coronavirus. We're doing our bit by staying indoors, but are the Government holding up their side of the bargain? Are they providing enough PPE? Are they providing enough tests? Are they providing economic stability? All this, and more, in this week's Full Disclosure. &#xD; Don't forget you can e-mail the show on coronacrisis@global.com</description>

    <description>Having worked as an MP under Margaret Thatcher, Matthew Parris shook the political hemisphere when he announced he was voting Liberal Democrat in the recent general election. A man of principle, his disdain of Brexit has never been a secret, and he willfully sold his Conservative roots to preserve his principles. So what caused this change of heart? And how does he feel about the looming, but steadily nearing, 31st January?</description>

    <description>One of Nazir Afzal's first jobs as chief crown prosecutor was on the Rochdale sex trafficking gang, overturning all previous decisions and initiating prosecutions. He brought the case to the public eye, and expose a deep-rooted evil operating previously without conviction. Afzal has spearheaded many inequality campaigns, fighting what he calls 'white male power' presiding over minority communities. Making his name as being one of the first to prosecute an honour killing, he is the true face of British justice.</description>

    <description>This week James O'Brien is joined by Brian Wood, a former Colour Sergeant who was awarded the Military Cross, one of Britain&#x2019;s highest awards for gallantry in combat, following his courageous leadership under enemy fire in Iraq. However, five years later he was wrongly accused of war crimes. In this episode, Brian discusses his love affair with the army, the public enquiry into the Battle of Danny Boy and how his reslience through these experiences led him to becoming a best selling author and public speaker, through sharing his experiences from the battlefield and suggesting ways that the lessons he has learnt can be applied in the corporate world.&#xD; &#xD; Full Disclosure is an in depth interview series chatting to the world's most fascinating people, hosted by James O'Brien. &#xD; &#xD; Rate and subscribe on Global Player or wherever you get your podcasts and connect with James on Twitter: @mrjamesob</description>

    <description>Former Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party, Lord Michael Heseltine, gives a searing account of his life and times in Politics. 'Ashamed' to be part of the generation that orchestrated Brexit, his is a stark warning against the current Tory party, gripped by the 'narrative of Farage' and invaded by Trumpism. Ahead of this week's general election, this is a must-listen.</description>

    <description>Growing up in Crawley, Romesh Ranganathan was given the name Jonathan by his parents - to help him 'fit in'. Now at 41, with a chart-topping podcast, a hit television series, and now a book, his aim is far from fitting in. During this in-depth conversation with James, Romesh talks mental health, the need for therapy, and the familial death that has come to shape him.</description>

    <description>In 1993, Hashi came to Britain as a child refugee. Listening to him now, a natural orator, it's hard to conceive he arrived speaking no English. Now a top Barrister, he's here to talk about social mobility, and how in these turbulent political times, this is the conversation we need to be having.</description>

    <description>Spacecraft near Earth have long relied on GPS signals for navigation, just as users on the ground might use their phones to navigate the highways. Farther away, navigation &#x2014; and the math behind it &#x2014; becomes a great deal more challenging.</description>

    <description>In the telephone switchboard&#x2019;s earliest days, the late 1800s, operators served a limited number of customers within their own communities. As telephone use expanded, automation helped switchboards keep up. NASA is working on a similar approach, infusing its satellite networks with a sort of artificial intelligence.</description>

    <description>"Form follows function" is an oft-cited architectural axiom. In space, form doesn&#x2019;t necessarily follow function. Human space habitation is rooted, by necessity, in pragmatism. The architectures of Earth won&#x2019;t work in space, but there is plenty to learn from Earthbound architectural theories as we extend our reach among the stars.</description>

    <description>The mythic hunter Orion, son of the sea-god Poseidon, was himself mortal, but his godly lineage enabled impossible heroic feats, earning him a place in the night sky as a constellation. NASA has developed its own Orion, a hunter for knowledge not of this Earth: a spacecraft designed for humanity&#x2019;s return to the Moon and exploration of deep space.</description>

    <description>For billions of years, the Earth and the Moon have danced together. Since the Apollo era, scientists have used lasers &#x2014; a technology then in its infancy &#x2014; to measure their waltz. Lasers have since played increasingly important roles in spaceflight. They may even play a part in keeping the next generation of lunar astronauts connected to home.</description>

    <description>At its core the NASA History Office ensures that, as we look forward to the Moon, Mars and beyond, we remember the lessons we&#x2019;ve learned from our predecessors. The race to the Moon in the 1960s occurred against a very different backdrop than today's Artemis program &#x2014; but both exhibit what humanity can achieve when we set ourselves to lofty aims.</description>

It&#x2019;s a magic that will flow through networks more sophisticated than ever before &#x2014; an appreciation for the technological wonders that lay ahead, just above and all around us.</description>

    <description>Amidst the grandeur of spaceflight, there is a tiny bit of technology that, if not for its major role, might otherwise go unnoticed: distress beacons. This NASA-developed search-and-rescue technology could be life-saving not just for astronauts, but for travelers across the globe as well.</description>

    <description>Without communications there is no exploration: To reveal the unknown, a spacecraft must be able to share its data. In a sense, today's space communications networks are like the roadways of ancient empires, allowing information to move across vast distances. But how might our satellite data highways evolve to enable exploration centuries from now?</description>

    <description>The 141st broadcast of VORW Int. Discussion on Kubrick is moved to the next show. Unfortunately I don't have any idea how strong Hurricane Dorian will be when it hits Florida, but if it is higher on the spectrum I likely will not have internet for extended periods of time. If you don't see any shows posted after this one for a while, it's because I do not have the means presently to make them. Stay safe everyone!

    <description>Behind the screen, a battle is raging. You can&#x2019;t see it. You may not even know it&#x2019;s taking place. That&#x2019;s the point. The Internet Watch Foundation works hard to make sure you never see some of the worst images of children being sexually abused. Every day, they see these videos, and they fight to get them taken down, and they work with governments, businesses, and law enforcement all around the world to make sure criminals have no place to hide. But could things be about to get worse? In this episode of Pixels from a Crime Scene, we explore what tech companies are doing in the global battle against child sexual abuse material, and how new online encryption could expose millions more to some of the worst material on the internet. </description>

    <description>It&#x2019;s a global industry, and it preys on children. A young girl is online. She makes a friend, and soon they&#x2019;re chatting, making jokes together and having a good time. But that friend is not who they say they are. Soon, the girl is being terrorized, coerced, bullied, and blackmailed into sending explicit images of herself to the stranger. All from her own bedroom in the family home. And then it gets worse. In this episode of Pixels from a Crime Scene, we talk to Rhiannon, a survivor of child sexual abuse, who was groomed by a predator on the internet when she was just 13. We expose how criminals are luring young victims into dangerous situations, and ask how safe are our children online?</description>

    <description>So, you think videos and pictures of children being sexually abused and raped only exist on the dark web? Think again. The epidemic of criminal content is out there on the open internet. It&#x2019;s being shared in apps we all use and can be found on sites where we all think everyone is safe. In this episode of Pixels from a Crime Scene, we hop on plane. From the Netherlands to the USA we follow the digital thread and see how sometimes the worst crimes are being perpetrated out in the open, sometimes in plain sight. We speak to investigative journalist and author/host of The Missing Cryptoqueen podcast Jamie Bartlett who takes us through the good and bad elements of the dark web.</description>

    <description>You shut down the laptop and watch the screen go black. What we&#x2019;ve learned together has been shocking. But the criminals haven&#x2019;t won. Far from it. Where there are the worst crimes, there is also the strongest resolve. While we see appalling abuse, we know there is also hope. In this, the final episode of Pixels from a Crime Scene, we set our sights on the future. A new, talented tech-savvy generation could hold the key to making the internet safe again for everyone, while an &#x201C;army of digital detectives&#x201D; could turn the tide against those who would exploit and abuse children. It is already happening. The Internet Watch Foundation is leading the charge to rid the internet of child sexual abuse material, and it is not alone. We know we can only do this if governments, companies, charities, law enforcement, and people all work together. We know it is possible. We know we can do it.</description>

    <description>The problem we are facing is staggering. Some experts warn 1% of the entire male population could have an interest in sex with prepubescent children. But what do you do when that problem is in your very own home? When someone you know is watching children being raped, tortured and sexually abused online? Someone you had trusted? In this episode of Pixels from a Crime Scene, we hear how addiction to criminal material tears families apart. We see how there is no such thing as a victimless crime where online child sexual abuse material is concerned, and how those viewing images and videos are complicit in the most horrendous abuse of innocent children. </description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jon Ronson, the creator of Audible Original&#xA0;&lt;em&gt;The Butterfly Effect&lt;/em&gt;, delves into the pornography industry again as he unravels the never-before-told story of what caused a beloved 23-year-old actress&#x2019;s untimely death.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In December 2017, famed adult film star August Ames died by suicide in a park in the Conejo Valley. Her death came just a day after she&#x2019;d been the victim of a social media pile-on by fellow porn professionals&#x2014;punishment for her tweeting out something deemed homophobic.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A month later, August&#x2019;s husband and pornography producer Kevin Moore connected with journalist Jon Ronson to tell the story of how cyberbullying via Twitter killed his wife. Neither of them could predict the rumors and secrets that Ronson would soon hear, revelations that hinted at a very different story&#x2014;something mysterious and unexpected and terrible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>In 2014, a businesswoman called Dr Ruja Ignatova launched a new cryptocurrency that promised to change money forever. OneCoin, she said, was similar to Bitcoin, only bigger, better and easier to use. Within two years, over 3 million people had joined the OneCoin revolution, and Dr Ruja became rich and famous. But then she suddenly disappeared and hasn&#x2019;t been seen since. For the last six months, writer and journalist Jamie Bartlett has been on the hunt to find The Missing Cryptoqueen. What he uncovers is a lot more than a missing woman. It's a story of greed, deceit and herd madness that takes him all over the world - and gets far weirder than he thought possible. New episodes every Thursday morning, starting 19th September.</description>

    <description>In Spring this year, something unexpected happened. On March 6th 2019, Dr Ruja's brother Konstantin was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport and charged with money laundering and fraud in connection with OneCoin. Dr Ruja was also charged in absentia, and US authorities declared OneCoin a fraud. We thought this could be the end of OneCoin, and our search. It wasn't. Why? The Missing Cryptoqueen is an eight-part series for BBC Sounds, with new episodes every Thursday.
